    <h1>CHAPTER 5</h1>
    <h1>Holbrooke, The Imperfect Wagnerite</h1>
    <p class="first-para-section dropcap">Joseph Holbrooke had much in common with the subject of the previous chapter. Born in the same year (1878), Holbrooke and Boughton both came from the ‘poorer middle-classes’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref2" href='#_ftn2'>[2]</a> they both dedicated a significant period of their lives to the composition of ambitious operatic cycles based on mythological themes and they were both committed nationalists. In other respects, there was much that set them apart. Boughton was a socialist, while Holbrooke was a reactionary conservative; Boughton was a genial character, while Holbrooke made enemies and launched vitriolic attacks on those who criticised him;&#8288;<a id="_ftnref3" href='#_ftn3'>[3]</a> and while parts of Boughton’s operatic pentalogy were performed on a threadbare budget in the cramped Glastonbury Assembly Rooms, the first two parts of Holbrooke’s trilogy were produced at great expense in London opera houses. Moreover, while Boughton actively promoted himself as a successor to Wagner, Holbrooke regarded his Wagnerian reputation as a curse. Indeed, as the twentieth century progressed Holbrooke would increasingly be dismissed as nothing more than an eccentric British Wagnerite, a ‘Cockney Wagner’ who composed an inferior, English version of Wagner’s <em>Ring</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref4" href='#_ftn4'>[4]</a></p>
    <p>      To a certain degree Holbrooke was justified in feeling unfairly pigeon-holed as a Wagnerite: many of the comparisons between his music dramas and Wagner’s were a result of the Wagnerian dimensions of his collaborator’s libretti, and Holbrooke’s musical style was shaped as much by Richard Strauss as by Wagner. Nonetheless, Holbrooke’s trilogy of music dramas based on Welsh legends – <em>The Cauldron of Annwn</em> – intersects with a number of recurring themes in the phenomenon of British musical Wagnerism. Not only did the Celtic pantheistic strand of Wagnerism, which first emerged in Bantock’s 1892 opera <em>Caedmar</em>, reappear in Holbrooke’s trilogy, but the desire for the regeneration of national culture that underpinned the trilogy was also a theme shared by many works of British Wagnerian composers, going back to Parry’s <em>Guenever</em>. Moreover, Holbrooke’s particular brand of nationalism, which often degenerated into xenophobia, racism and anti-Semitism, aligns him and his work with darker currents of European Wagnerism that were otherwise not a prominent feature of the phenomenon in Britain. </p>
    <p>Like many other British composers of his generation, Holbrooke’s interest in Wagner can be traced back to his studies at the RAM with Frederick Corder, whose piano, Holbrooke recalled, ‘was never seen without Wagner’s vocal scores on it’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref5" href='#_ftn5'>[5]</a> Holbrooke entered the RAM in 1893, a year after Bantock had graduated, and left in 1896. Following his studies, Holbrooke struggled to earn a living for a few years,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref6" href='#_ftn6'>[6]</a> but his fortunes began to change when his tone poem <em>The Raven</em> was performed under the baton of August Manns at the Crystal Palace in March 1900. Later in the same year Holbrooke befriended Bantock, who took the younger composer under his wing, allowing Holbrooke to stay at his house in Birmingham for some months and offering him a teaching job at the Midlands Institute. Bantock also introduced Holbrooke to the critic and Wagnerite Ernest Newman, and the three were good friends for a number of years before Newman and Holbrooke had a spectacular falling out.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref7" href='#_ftn7'>[7]</a> Holbrooke soon began to establish a reputation for himself as a young, progressive composer of tone poems in the Lisztian-Straussian tradition.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref8" href='#_ftn8'>[8]</a></p>
    <p>      The year 1908 marked the beginning of Holbrooke’s adventures in the world of music drama. The start of that year witnessed the performance of his so-called ‘illuminated symphony’, <em>Apollo and the Seaman</em>, an orchestral work with a choral epilogue inspired by a complex philosophical poem about immortality by the Irish poet Herbert Trench (1865–1923). In the lead-up to the premiere at the Queen’s Hall on 20 January the audience was promised a ‘new art form’ which was to constitute a ‘reversion to the earliest Greek theory on the respective functions of the two arts’ of music and poetry.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref9" href='#_ftn9'>[9]</a> The innovatory performance required an orchestra hidden behind a large screen onto which were projected, by means of a magic lantern, the words of Trench’s poem, changing in sync with the corresponding passages of music.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref10" href='#_ftn10'>[10]</a> The intention, according to the programme, was ‘to enable the eye and intelligence to cooperate with the ear’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref11" href='#_ftn11'>[11]</a> The references to Ancient Greece, to a new art form and to a fusion of music and poetry, combined with the huge scale of the work – in terms of the size of the orchestra and the duration (over an hour long) – all indicate that this ambitious project was Wagnerian in nature, and in that respect it heralded the direction that Holbrooke’s career was about to take.</p>
    <p>Although it was not received well by the critics, the premiere of <em>Apollo and the Seaman</em> changed the course of Holbrooke’s life for the better.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref12" href='#_ftn12'>[12]</a> Thomas Evelyn Scott-Ellis, the 8th Baron Howard de Walden (1880–1946),&#8288;<a id="_ftnref13" href='#_ftn13'>[13]</a> had attended the rehearsals and the performance, and he had been impressed by Holbrooke’s music.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref14" href='#_ftn14'>[14]</a> Trench arranged for Holbrooke to meet Ellis who, after inheriting his family’s enormous wealth and property in 1899, became one of the richest men in Britain. Ellis was an amateur musician himself and a generous patron of the arts, and from 1908 onwards Holbrooke benefitted enormously from the Baron’s financial generosity.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref15" href='#_ftn15'>[15]</a> Rob Barnett notes that Ellis </p>
    <blockquote><p>paid for Holbrooke concerts, for cars, for holidays in Wales and the French Riviera, for writing of scores and parts, and for living expenses. The composer joined the de Waldens on Mediterranean cruises aboard the family motor yacht and on safaris in Africa and tours to then exotic places.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref16" href='#_ftn16'>[16]</a></p></blockquote>
    <p>It was not long after their first meeting that the pair began their collaboration on what would eventually become the operatic trilogy <em>The Cauldron of Annwn</em>. The three dramas that make up the trilogy – <em>The Children of Don</em>, <em>Dylan: Son of the Wave</em> and <em>Bronwen</em> – were loosely based on the events and characters described in two stories from Charlotte Guest’s 1877 translation of <em>The Mabinogion</em>, a collection of Welsh tales and legends.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref17" href='#_ftn17'>[17]</a> Having already written a version of <em>Dylan</em> before meeting Holbrooke, it was this drama which Ellis first gave to the composer to set to music. Holbrooke began the composition of <em>Dylan</em> in late 1908 and completed it 1910; <em>Don</em> was composed between 1909 and 1912; and <em>Bronwen</em> was completed in 1920.</p>
    <p>      Ellis funded the lavish London productions of both <em>Don</em> and <em>Dylan</em>, which took place in 1912 and 1914 respectively. According to one account, he paid £32,000 for the three performances of <em>Don</em>, a sum that in today’s money would be equivalent to millions of pounds.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref18" href='#_ftn18'>[18]</a> <em>Bronwen</em> was not performed until 1929 and was produced first in Huddersfield (1 February) and then in a number of other British cities (including Newcastle, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham, Middlesbrough, Glasgow and Edinburgh) by the Carl Rosa Opera Company.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref19" href='#_ftn19'>[19]</a> As the performances of <em>Bronwen</em> lie outside of the chronological focus of this study, this chapter will focus on <em>Don</em> and <em>Dylan</em> (see Appendix I for plot synopses). Tables 5.1 and 5.2 summarise the dates and people involved in the productions of <em>Don</em> and <em>Dylan</em>, as far as can be gleaned from the available sources.</p>

    <h2>5.1 <em>The</em> <em>Cauldron of Annwn</em>: The Music and the Libretti</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">Unlike Boughton, who published dozens of articles that provide an insight into the aesthetics that underpinned his compositional practice, Holbrooke rarely wrote about his music or theoretical ideas in any detail. An exception is an article he wrote in 1908 entitled ‘The Modern Advance in Music’. This reveals that Holbrooke shared ideas about music with other British Wagnerians such as Boughton, Wallace and Bantock. Holbrooke argued that ‘Music is an expression of feeling’, that the best music is written by the composer ‘feeling deeply over the circumstances of his own life’ and that music should be ‘the expression of ideas’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref20" href='#_ftn20'>[20]</a> While the latter statement is consistent with British musical Wagnerian aesthetics going back to Bantock and Wallace in the 1890s, the suggestion that music should be an expression of feelings directly linked to one’s own life bears a particular resemblance to aspects of Boughton’s aesthetic ideas. Holbrooke’s description of music as ‘an emotional art’ and his praise of music that is ‘religious’, a word he uses in the ‘broadest sense’, further suggest a kinship with Boughton’s Wagnerian theories.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref21" href='#_ftn21'>[21]</a> </p>
    <p>At the end of the ‘Modern Advance’ article Holbrooke predicted that the music of the future would ‘deal more and more with poetry’, that these two arts would ‘begin to form a speech’ and that ‘in time to come music will be, as Mr. William Wallace has recently hinted, the ethics of the world’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref22" href='#_ftn22'>[22]</a> Holbrooke’s desire for music and poetry to become more closely integrated is typical of the intermedial aesthetics espoused by British Wagnerians. His belief that music would become ‘the ethics of the world’ also points to Holbrooke’s connection with one of the principal themes of British Wagnerism: re-enchantment. Just as Boughton used the word ‘ethics’ almost synonymously with religion, so too in this instance did Holbrooke, in effect employing the term to imply that music could become the new ‘religion’ of the world. Like many of his contemporaries, Holbrooke appears to have been referring to music’s potential function as a substitute for religion in a secularised, rationalised society – an idea Wagner himself had already alluded to when he wrote that art could ‘rescue the essence of religion’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref23" href='#_ftn23'>[23]</a></p>
    <p>It was Wagner to whom Holbrooke turned in the article to provide an example of a composer who was able ‘honestly’ to express his own feelings in music and consequently able to ‘make other people feel’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref24" href='#_ftn24'>[24]</a> There are limited accounts of Holbrooke’s views on Wagner before the First World War, but an interview he gave in 1912 further illustrates his admiration for the German composer. Holbrooke was largely opposed to Italian and French models of opera, and he criticised the producer of <em>Don</em>, Oscar Hammerstein, for his tendency to produce Italian and French works at the expense of all others: ‘At present I keep saying to him, “Your repertory is futile! Why not do ‘Tristan,’ ‘Meistersinger,’ and Strauss?”’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref25" href='#_ftn25'>[25]</a> Holbrooke also expressed his dislike of what he regarded as the silly and stereotypical conventions of Italian opera:</p>
    <blockquote><p>Italian opera is worked out. The modern Italian opera consists of nothing but the old love duet—oh, that love duet!—with, by way of something modern, conversational interjections like this: ‘Show Mrs. Maccaroni in!’ ‘Take a seat!’ ‘How do you do?’ ‘Good day!’ I want something a little deeper, a little more imaginative and poetic, than the Italians and Frenchmen can give us, and so does any cultivated musical, national-feeling Englishman, I believe. […] Of course, Wagner is a god, and Strauss is great—far and away the greatest of all living musicians.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref26" href='#_ftn26'>[26]</a></p></blockquote>
    <p>In remarks made a few years later, however Holbrooke criticised aspects of Wagner’s music dramas. In particular, he criticised the <em>Ring</em> and <em>Die Meistersinger</em> for being too long and for the action moving too slowly: ‘The music of the “Ring” is one long sermon’, he told his biographer, George Lowe.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref27" href='#_ftn27'>[27]</a> Ultimately, although Holbrooke admired Wagner’s ‘glorious music’ – his ‘mighty power as a musician pure and simple’ – he disliked Wagner’s ‘so-called philosophy’, which he felt made the plot of the <em>Ring</em> ‘illogical’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref28" href='#_ftn28'>[28]</a> This desire to distance himself from the Meister was almost certainly motivated by a desire to avoid accusations of being an inferior imitator of Wagner.</p>
    <p>      The music of <em>Dylan</em> and <em>The Children of</em> <em>Don</em> was influenced as much by Strauss, and to a lesser extent by Debussy, as it was by Wagner. It was Strauss whom Holbrooke admired more than any other composer, describing him as ‘the greatest musical tone-painter in the world’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref29" href='#_ftn29'>[29]</a> Holbrooke acquired (or at least cemented) his love of Strauss through Bantock, with whom he used to play piano duet arrangements of Strauss’s tone-poems,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref30" href='#_ftn30'>[30]</a> and he built his reputation as a composer at the start of the century on his Straussian tone-poems. Consequently, by the time he composed <em>Dylan</em> and <em>Don</em> his technique was thoroughly imbued with Straussian characteristics.</p>
    <p>      Most critics, however, viewed the Straussian and Debussyan aspects of <em>Don</em> and <em>Dylan</em> as secondary elements built on top of what were Wagnerian foundations, as demonstrated by the various descriptions of these works as ‘post-Wagnerian Wagner’, ‘steeped in Wagner’, ‘overshadowed by Wagnerian influences’, ‘just an imitation of Wagner’, being in a ‘pseudo-Wagnerian style’ and suffering from ‘acute Wagnerism’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref31" href='#_ftn31'>[31]</a> All the usual musical characteristics associated with Wagnerian music drama were identified in <em>Don</em> and <em>Dylan</em> by the critics. These included a declamatory vocal style and, as a result, a lack of extended lyrical passages; a largely continuous, through-composed texture, with the exception of a few self-contained pieces such as Nodens’s Song in the prologue of <em>Don</em>;&#8288;<a id="_ftnref32" href='#_ftn32'>[32]</a> and a system of leitmotifs associated with characters, objects and emotions, some of which are interrelated and some of which are heard in all three dramas.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref33" href='#_ftn33'>[33]</a></p>
    <p>On the whole, the music of <em>Dylan</em> was received more favourably than <em>Don</em> because it was considered less Wagnerian, a perception shaped in particular by the extensive use of the chorus in <em>Dylan</em>. Ernest Newman, for example, wrote that he preferred the music of <em>Dylan</em> over <em>Don</em>:</p>
    <blockquote><p>it is fresher, more spontaneous than that of its [compositional] successor, and in one or two places, such as the choruses in the second Act and the monologue of the Sea King, it attains to a power that gives us a new respect for Mr. Holbrooke. If any Englishman can write a good opera it is he, provided he meets with the right sort of text. But he and everyone else should give up the pseudo-Wagnerian style.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref34" href='#_ftn34'>[34]</a></p></blockquote>
    <p class="first-para-section">Other critics who reviewed the score in 1911 suggested that Holbrooke’s <em>Dylan</em> was ‘brilliantly differentiated’ from Wagner ‘by the chorus’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref35" href='#_ftn35'>[35]</a> and that although the work was ‘of the Wagnerian type and school’ it was ‘an <em>English</em> Wagner’ due to being ‘rich in one element Wagner foolishly left out on purpose, mostly—the chorus’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref36" href='#_ftn36'>[36]</a></p>
    <p>The prominence of the chorus in <em>Dylan</em> was in part due to the fact that Holbrooke initially planned to set the text as an orchestral-choral work that would be referred to as a ‘symphony’, rather like <em>Apollo and the Seaman</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref37" href='#_ftn37'>[37]</a> Moreover, it is likely that Holbrooke wanted to use the chorus for the same reasons as Boughton did: the chorus was considered a fundamentally English device. In <em>Don</em>, however, the second drama to be composed, Holbrooke abandoned the choral approach, in part because Ellis’s text did not allow for it. On the whole, <em>Don</em> is written in a more complex and denser musical language than <em>Dylan</em>, as evidenced by a comparison of their respective overtures. The overture to <em>Don</em> illustrates the full range of Holbrooke’s expressive, late-romantic musical language. The nervous, agitated atmosphere that dominates much of the overture, the repeated, fragmentary and chromatic figurations, and the rapidly rising and falling patterns in dotted, semiquaver and triplet rhythms all echo Strauss. Other moments, such as the parallel inverted triads and seventh chords at fig. 14:4, bring the music into the orbit of a Debussyan soundworld. The extensive chromaticism, though filtered through Strauss, still owes much to Wagner, as do the yearning suspensions and appoggiaturas that are prominent in the overture’s more lyrical passages, such as that between figs. 13 and 14.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref38" href='#_ftn38'>[38]</a> Another lyrical section at the end of the overture (Ex. 5.1), based on a major-key version of the ‘Nodens’ motif, further illustrates Holbrooke’s late-romantic harmonic vocabulary: it employs all kinds of seventh, ninth, eleventh and thirteenth chords, augmented chords, diminished and half-diminished seventh chords, chromatic alterations, appoggiaturas and suspensions. But although Holbrooke’s music for <em>Don</em> and <em>Dylan</em> clearly situated itself in a Wagnerian-Straussian tradition, it was ultimately a result of Ellis’s Wagnerian libretto – for <em>Don</em> especially – that encouraged critics to consider the whole trilogy in Wagnerian terms. </p>
    <p>In his autobiography Holbrooke wrote of Ellis’s ‘love of Strauss and Wagner’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref39" href='#_ftn39'>[39]</a> and Ellis’s interest in the latter led to a trip to Bayreuth in 1909 where he saw <em>Parsifal</em> and the <em>Ring</em>, accompanied by Holbrooke, Trench, and the Irish Wagnerite George Moore, among others.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref40" href='#_ftn40'>[40]</a> Taking into account Ellis’s Wagnerian inclinations, it seems likely that his interest in using the <em>Mabinogion</em> stories as a basis for a series of music dramas was in part due to their similarities with the tales told in <em>Ring</em>, both in scope and content. Moreover, the <em>Mabinogion</em> provided a lesser-known alternative to the Arthurian cycle which was the more obvious source upon which to base a British <em>Ring</em>.</p>
    <p>While Wagner’s work evidently functioned as a model for the scenario of Ellis’s trilogy, the German composer’s influence does not seem to have extended to Ellis’s poetic technique. The libretto for <em>Don</em>,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref41" href='#_ftn41'>[41]</a> for instance, makes no attempt at the quasi-Wagnerian alliterative verse that can be found in Buckley’s libretto for <em>The Birth of Arthur</em>. A number of contemporary reviewers suggested that the dramas were written in some kind of blank verse,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref42" href='#_ftn42'>[42]</a> but parts of Ellis’s texts displays a strong reliance on rhyme. However, neither the rhyme scheme nor the metre is consistent throughout much of the libretti for the <em>Annwn</em> dramas, leading critics such as Gerald Cumberland to write that the verse in <em>Dylan</em> was ‘strange and undisciplined’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref43" href='#_ftn43'>[43]</a></p>

    <p>The libretti for <em>Don</em> and <em>Dylan</em> were widely criticised in the press following their premieres, not only for inconsistent style, but also for what Ernest Newman referred to as ‘Wardour Street English’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref44" href='#_ftn44'>[44]</a> Compounding the problems inherent in the libretti was the fact that the audience struggled to hear the words being sung at the performances of <em>Don</em> and <em>Dylan</em>. Edward Algernon Baughan wrote in the <em>Observer</em> following <em>Don</em> that he could hardly hear ‘more than two complete sentences’ during the entire performance.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref45" href='#_ftn45'>[45]</a> Similarly, Ernest Newman summed up the experience of many in the audience at the premiere of <em>Dylan</em>:</p>
    <blockquote><p>Anyone who strolled casually into Drury Lane last night without knowing what was in the bill might have sat there for half an hour or so believing that he was listening to yet another Russian opera; then, to his amazement, he would catch a word or two of English, and at the end of the act he would discover from the programme that it was Mr. Holbrooke’s ‘Dylan’ that was being given.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref46" href='#_ftn46'>[46]</a></p></blockquote>
    <p>      The reason why so many critics measured the success of <em>Don</em> against Wagner’s <em>Ring</em> lay not in the technique of the libretto, however, but in its plot. The parallels between the <em>Cauldron of Annwn</em> – <em>Don</em>, especially – and Wagner’s <em>Ring</em> are numerous. There was some disagreement among critics as to which Wagnerian characters acted as the prototypes for those in <em>Don</em>, but most suggested that Nodens, an ancient god who is awoken from a deep enchanted sleep, was a male version of Wagner’s Erda.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref47" href='#_ftn47'>[47]</a> Some reports identified Nodens with Wotan,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref48" href='#_ftn48'>[48]</a> however, and Don, the ‘nature’ or ‘earth Goddess’, with Erda.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref49" href='#_ftn49'>[49]</a> Gwydion, meanwhile, was compared with Wotan and, more accurately, with Siegfried.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref50" href='#_ftn50'>[50]</a> Dylan, the hero who brings the promise of the ‘redemption of the race’ at the end of <em>Don</em>, and the man speared in the back by a betrayer in <em>Dylan</em>, was also regarded as a Siegfried-like character and even as a Parsifal due to his status as a ‘Child of Nature’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref51" href='#_ftn51'>[51]</a> Finally, Govannion, the villainous character who murders Dylan, was described by one critic as ‘Hagenlike’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref52" href='#_ftn52'>[52]</a></p>
    <p>In addition to the analogies between Wagner’s and Ellis’s characters, other events, themes and objects in the <em>Annwn</em> trilogy solidified the Wagnerian connections. Above all, the Cauldron, a source of wisdom, knowledge and power which also curses those who possess it, and the object that links all three dramas, displays clear parallels with the Ring of Wagner’s eponymous tetralogy.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref53" href='#_ftn53'>[53]</a> Ellis’s trilogy even begins with the theft or ‘rape’ – a word used in the libretto – of the Cauldron by Gwydion, recalling the theft of the Ring at the opening of <em>Das Rheingold</em>. The motivations behind the theft in each case are very different, however: Gwydion takes the Cauldron to liberate man; Alberich takes the Ring to empower himself and enslave the Nibelungs. The final scene of <em>Don</em>, during which Gwydion kills Math, destroys his staff and then proclaims ‘The rod is broken Math did wield. / His power’s dispelled, and in release / Stand we unfettered’, is a reinvention of the shattering of Wotan’s spear by Siegfried, and with it the destruction of the power and authority that it represented. Elan’s incestuous love for her brother Gwydion in the earlier part of <em>Don</em> perhaps echoes <em>Die Walküre</em> (though, unlike in <em>Die Walküre</em>, the love is not consummated as Gwydion rejects Elan’s advances), and the Act II scene in which the pair drink a magic potion is reminiscent of the first act of <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>. </p>
    <p>All these specific parallels, in combination with <em>Don</em>’s overarching theme of mankind’s struggle for freedom from the power of the gods and its expression of a sense of race and nationality, demonstrate the influence of the <em>Ring</em> on Ellis. Unfortunately for Ellis and Holbrooke, the comparisons with Wagner in the reviews of <em>Don</em> and <em>Dylan</em> were used for the most part in order to point out how their work compared unfavourably with that of the German composer: critics complained that their dramas were gloomier and darker than Wagner’s; that they were not truly British; that their plots were not clear; that they were not dramatic like Wagner’s;&#8288;<a id="_ftnref54" href='#_ftn54'>[54]</a> and, above all, that their characters had no ‘human appeal’, unlike those of the <em>Ring</em>, meaning that they ‘convey[ed] no message to us of the twentieth century’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref55" href='#_ftn55'>[55]</a></p>
    <p>According to the programme sold at the premiere of <em>Don</em>, written by Owen Rhoscomyl (pseudonym of Arthur Owen Vaughan), the main themes of the drama, rather like those of the <em>Ring</em> and Shelley’s <em>Prometheus</em>, were ‘the war of man against the baleful Gods of darkness’ and ‘the noble struggle of man to be master of his own soul, and in that theme to adumbrate the evolution of our own island race’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref56" href='#_ftn56'>[56]</a> Despite the possible political allegory to be found in this rather Shavian reading of the opera, there seems to have been no great political motivation behind <em>The Cauldron of Annwn</em>. The clues we have regarding Holbrooke’s political leanings suggest that he would not have been particularly sympathetic towards Rhoscomyl’s interpretation, especially not towards the implicit suggestion of the presence of revolutionary themes in the drama. Though few of Holbrooke’s published writings discussed politics directly, one may surmise that he was conservative. This is indicated by his dislike of free trade, expressed in a letter to Bantock in which he referred to the latter’s home as a ‘den of free trade (curse it!)’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref57" href='#_ftn57'>[57]</a> and, conversely, his support of Tariff Reform.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref58" href='#_ftn58'>[58]</a> Holbrooke also mocked the ‘so-called’ Liberal Party and lamented that the ‘nascent dukes’ who had provided patronage to composers in the age of Mozart and Haydn had now been replaced by ‘Socialists, Labour Leaders, Trade Unions, Bernard Shaw! Lloyd George! “Home Rule!” and a thousand other distractions’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref59" href='#_ftn59'>[59]</a> Holbrooke’s hatred of ‘the despicable writings of G. Bernard Shaw’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref60" href='#_ftn60'>[60]</a> in particular, would seem to rule out any possibility that he would have welcomed a Shavian reading of his own opera. </p>
    <p>As for Ellis, it seems unlikely that an aristocrat would intentionally write a libretto that alludes to the usurpation of a powerful ruling class (the ‘Gods’) by another group (‘man’). But does this mean that Ellis was so absorbed by the task of creating a British version of Wagner’s <em>Ring</em> that he was simply oblivious to the potential significance of the story? A more generous reading of the libretto of <em>Don</em> could offer an explanation that would not be at odds with Ellis’s own position in British society. Essential to this reading of <em>Don</em> is the fact that there is more than one type of god in the libretto. As the programme explained, ‘man’ – or at least one man, Gwydion – was fighting against the ‘Bitter Gods’ and their mortal followers – represented by Don, Math and Arawn. These gods were ‘themselves but rebels and conquerors of the earliest gods of all, those darkling personifications of the elements and of chaos and the abyss’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref61" href='#_ftn61'>[61]</a> These more ancient gods are represented in the drama by the Erda-like Nodens who supports Gwydion’s rebellion throughout the drama. In Act I it is Nodens who instructs the Sea-King, Lyd, not to harm Gwydion as Don asked him to, and Nodens prophesises that it will be through man that his dreams for a better future for his island race will be realised. Similarly, in Act II when Gwydion calls on Nodens, the ancient god proclaims that ‘The gods in agony must waste / To be by nascent man replaced’. In the last two lines of the drama Gwydion predicts that Nodens’s dreams shall eventually be fulfilled by Dylan: ‘But Nodens dreams on, and we can still be brave / And while ‘tis so the islands shall not fail’. It is possible, then, that Lord Howard de Walden identified himself and his class with this noble and somewhat aristocratic god, Nodens, and saw this god’s alliance with Gwydion as an alliance between an old order of upper-class gentlemen and the kind of free-thinking artists whom Ellis supported (Holbrooke, Sime, Moore, etc.). Both are opposed to a bourgeois, commercial and materialist spirit represented by the ‘Bitter Gods’. Indeed, in his preface to the libretto of the trilogy, it is characteristics associated with this kind of individualist spirit or attitude that Ellis singles out for criticism:</p>
    <blockquote><p>If there is any inference or general feeling that flows from the <em>Mabinogion</em> it is that personal ambition is the first and the worst of the passions, the quickest for inflammation and the furthest from the three drops of wisdom.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref62" href='#_ftn62'>[62]</a></p></blockquote>
    <p>While this reading might plausibly explain Ellis’s perspective on his libretto, it does not adequately account for Holbrooke’s interest in the story. As Rob Barnett points out ‘Holbrooke diligently pursued both high art and the commercial mass market’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref63" href='#_ftn63'>[63]</a> and thus hardly saw himself as a purveyor of ideals that stood outside of mass culture and popular concerns. Holbrooke’s interest in the story, then, was probably not political. Part of the reason why Holbrooke accepted Ellis’s clearly problematic libretto was probably that the composer would have been reluctant to criticise the work of the man who paid for him to live a fairly comfortable life for many decades.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref64" href='#_ftn64'>[64]</a> But there were two less cynical elements in the appeal of Ellis’s libretti to Holbrooke: their ideas pertaining to nationalism and race, and wild, Celtic nature imagery. </p>
    <p>As ever in the works of the British composers considered in this thesis, nationalism and Celticism are linked to the broader themes of British Wagnerism: regeneration and re-enchantment. In fact, both of these overarching themes are alluded to in the final remarks of Ellis’s preface to the trilogy’s libretto: </p>
    <blockquote><p>I tried to invent a primaeval folk with faith because I had none. […] For though new streams set in over the broken lands and all our shores are strange; though the dynasties are gone and honour seems lost under the queer jetsam of these tides:—yet Nodens dreams on.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref65" href='#_ftn65'>[65]</a></p></blockquote>
    <p>The notion of regeneration is also firmly embedded in the plots of <em>Don</em> and <em>Dylan</em>, not only through the promise of redemption inherent in the birth of Dylan in <em>Don</em>, but also in <em>Dylan</em> when, after a <em>Götterdämmerung</em>-like deluge at the end of the opera, the Sea-King reflects on the cyclical nature of life before the day dawns at the drama’s conclusion, signifying the promise of renewal. Moreover, another of Ellis’s comments in the preface to his libretto – that he believed there was at his present time ‘an awakening in the race’ that needed to be encouraged – shows that, like many other Wagnerian regeneration operas, the hope of regeneration expressed by the <em>Annwn</em> dramas was projected onto modern society, or to be specific in this case, modern-day Britain.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref66" href='#_ftn66'>[66]</a> When one takes into account Holbrooke’s ideas about nationality and race, the themes of national renewal in the trilogy acquire dark undertones that reveal how easily Wagnerism could lapse into ideas about racial purity, cultural protectionism and xenophobia.</p>
    <h2>5.2 Nationalism and Racism</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">If there is one theme in Holbrooke’s writings that emerges as his principal concern, it is that of music and nationalism. In his published articles in periodicals, his private correspondence and his 1925 book <em>Contemporary British Composers</em>,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref67" href='#_ftn67'>[67]</a> Holbrooke returned obsessively to issues surrounding the performance and promotion of British music and to what he considered to be the disproportionate attention and privilege afforded to foreign composers and musicians. At the start of <em>Contemporary British Composers</em>, Holbrooke proclaimed that he was a ‘Nationalist in art, as in politics’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref68" href='#_ftn68'>[68]</a> and Paul Watt has recently argued that Holbrooke adopted ‘a <em>protectionist ideology</em>’ whereby ‘English and British culture defends itself against foreign influence’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref69" href='#_ftn69'>[69]</a> Indeed, Holbrooke’s cultural protectionism complemented his protectionist beliefs in the political and economic spheres.</p>
    <p>      Holbrooke’s principal complaints outlined in <em>Contemporary British Composers</em> include the lack of performances of British music in general, the first-performance ‘fetish’ (that is, the lack of repeat performances of ‘native’ music), the treatment of British music by the press, the lack of funding provided for British music and composers (either by wealthy individuals or the state), and the dominance of foreign music and musicians in concert halls and opera houses (especially Covent Garden). These complaints were hardly unique to Holbrooke, of course. In certain respects, they were simply a continuation of the ideas outlined in Wallace and Bantock’s 1896 concert ‘manifesto’, which bemoaned ‘the prevailing taste for foreign music’ and the lack of opportunities for British composers (see Chapter 3). But Holbrooke pursued this agenda far more persistently, polemically and, sometimes, nastily than his colleagues. </p>
    <p>Holbrooke attempted to put his ideals into practice with the productions of his own operas in 1912 and 1914. Oscar Hammerstein, the producer of <em>Don</em>, was tasked with ‘the production of a British opera with, so far as possible, British singers’, and apparently auditioned ‘hundreds’ of people in the casting process in order to achieve this goal.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref70" href='#_ftn70'>[70]</a> Judging from the names of the cast members of <em>Don</em> (see above, Table 1.1), Holbrooke’s plan was only partially successful. Holbrooke believed that to be truly British one had to have ‘Solid British names and parentage’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref71" href='#_ftn71'>[71]</a> and a number of names in the cast list suggest otherwise. All of the singers at the premiere of <em>Dylan</em> two years later, however, do appear to have been ‘British’ (according to Holbrooke’s criteria), causing the <em>Observer</em> to remark that the performance ‘was an all-British production in the purest sense of the word’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref72" href='#_ftn72'>[72]</a></p>
    <p>Watt notes that Holbrooke promoted a ‘nineteenth-century view of nationalism’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref73" href='#_ftn73'>[73]</a> In fact, when combined with the composer’s endeavours in the world of music-drama, Holbrooke’s brand of nationalism and ideas about race might be seen as distinctly Wagnerian in character. Indeed, parts of the press suggested around the time of the performance of <em>Don</em> that Holbrooke and Ellis’s work might ‘do the same for the British race’ that the <em>Ring</em> had done ‘in creating and crystallising a sense of race among the Germans’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref74" href='#_ftn74'>[74]</a> For Holbrooke, one important element in crystallising such a sense of race was to have the dramas performed by the people of the nation, though he did not subscribe to the utopian social(ist) dimension of the <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em> in the way that Boughton did. When it came to the controversial style in which Holbrooke wrote about issues of music, nationalism and race, however, it was he and not Boughton who emerged as the more authentic Wagnerite. Holbrooke often dressed up his rants about British and foreign music and musicians with the language of war and invasion. In an interview with the <em>Daily Mail</em> prior to the premiere of <em>Don</em> in 1912, Holbrooke expressed his disdain for Covent Garden’s ‘meaningless glorification of alien art’, and claimed that his opera constituted ‘a breach in the defences of the alien operatic forces’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref75" href='#_ftn75'>[75]</a> Unsurprisingly, during the First World War Holbrooke directed his hatred of ‘aliens’ towards Germans in particular, writing articles with titles such as ‘The Case Against German Music’, ‘The Case for British Music’ and ‘British Music v. German Music’. Though Holbrooke’s views on foreign musicians remained largely unchanged before, during and after the war, he expressed these opinions more vehemently once the war had begun and some of his writings became explicitly racist and xenophobic. An article published in December 1914, for instance, included statements such as the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>as I write, we are in the midst of a bloody war, and our patriotic music is such, that when we want any attention brought to our fine armies’ prowess, or when we want a new army, the music we are regaled with is by foreign Jews—in nearly all cases—anyway, by foreigners, and worse still, nearly all so rank as music, and the sentiment, that I vomit at the memory of it alone! […]</p>
      <p>      In several patriotic plays running in London theatres the orchestras are conducted by unnaturalised enemies and the same exists in the orchestra.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref76" href='#_ftn76'>[76]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>      As the above passage illustrates, Holbrooke’s prejudices were not limited to his dislike of foreign musicians; they also manifested in the form of a nasty, recurring strand of anti-Semitism in his writings. This is most apparent in the series of articles and correspondence Holbrooke wrote for the <em>The New Age</em> magazine in 1914.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref77" href='#_ftn77'>[77]</a> The first hints of Holbrooke’s anti-Semitism appear in his response to Edwin Evans’s criticisms of an article he had written titled ‘British Music’. The article contained all of the composer’s usual complaints regarding the lack of repeat performances of British works and the dominance of foreign music and musicians in Britain.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref78" href='#_ftn78'>[78]</a> Evans provided a robust critique of Holbrooke’s argument, not only criticising Holbrooke’s own contribution to British music, suggesting that the performance of <em>The Children of Don</em> had dealt a ‘deathblow’ to English opera, but damning British composers as a whole as ignorant, parochial artists who had failed to realise their potential.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref79" href='#_ftn79'>[79]</a> Holbrooke struck back with a sarcastic and venomous letter, accusing Evans of understanding ‘no music whatever’ and pointing out that the critic could not, ‘poor dear, write a bar of [music] himself’. At the end of the letter Holbrooke suggests that Evans should no longer attend ‘performances of any British music with a mind clouded with the fungus of the Jewish-ap-German-ap-French-ap-Hungarian-ap-Russian music’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref80" href='#_ftn80'>[80]</a> A fortnight later, after the magazine published another letter criticising Holbrooke – this time by the critic and musician M. Montagu-Nathan – Holbrooke’s anti-Semitism became personal: ‘It would be a pity’, Holbrooke sneered, ‘to take up any more of your space with the “slush” of Mr. Montagu-Nathan (sounds Semitic!)’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref81" href='#_ftn81'>[81]</a></p>
    <p>      It was, however, in a series of articles and letters on the subject of ‘British Music v. German Music’ published in November and December of 1914 that Holbrooke unleashed his hatred of Jews and Jewishness. Not only did Holbrooke link what he referred to as ‘the vacuous rot of the theatres’ with ‘dishonest and “Jewish” practices’, and single out British-Jewish composers such as Frederick Cowen, Paul Rubens and Herman Finck for criticism,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref82" href='#_ftn82'>[82]</a> he also perpetuated a number of other common Jewish stereotypes:</p>
    <blockquote><p>this is the truth I state, let it offend no one—the Jews are very powerful. They are not to be found in our Army, they do not fight! The music-halls, the theatres, the Stock Exchange are their ground. They are good citizens, which means that they invariably settle down in a country like ours which they can hoodwink. The sojourn of various alien Jew financiers still here cannot be explained to any common-sense citizen, but the Radical party seem to understand it very well!&#8288;<a id="_ftnref83" href='#_ftn83'>[83]</a></p></blockquote>
    <p>      While a fundamental aspect of the works and ideas of a number of other British Wagnerian composers from this era was an interest in nationalism and race, Holbrooke’s anti-Semitism set him apart not only from most of his fellow composers but from British Wagnerism as a whole.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref84" href='#_ftn84'>[84]</a> Anne Dzamba Sessa observes that prominent Wagnerites in England, such as Ellis and Hueffer, and English Wagnerians more generally, were often embarrassed by Wagner’s anti-Semitism, and they ‘ignored or attempted to explain away’ the composer’s racism and other controversial views.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref85" href='#_ftn85'>[85]</a> Emma Sutton also suggests that Wagnerism in Britain did not, on the whole, adopt the more unpleasant polemical edge associated with the <em>Bayreuther Blätter</em> brand of Wagnerism.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref86" href='#_ftn86'>[86]</a></p>
    <p>Though Holbrooke’s anti-Semitism sits awkwardly in the context of British Wagnerism, it could be viewed in the context of a broader European current of anti-Semitism among a certain group of Wagner’s followers who, in the wake of the Meister’s death, continued to link Jews and music by Jewish composers to degeneration. One of the most prominent representatives of this group was the English-born but later German citizen Houston Stewart Chamberlain, who married Wagner’s daughter, Eva, and became a key figure in the Bayreuth circle. Chamberlain’s biography, <em>Richard Wagner</em>, first published in English in 1897, included a section titled ‘Richard Wagner’s Doctrine of Regeneration’, in which the author outlined the ‘causes’ of degeneration identified by Wagner, including ‘Deterioration of the blood, and the demoralizing influence of the Jews […] the fundamental causes of our decadence’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref87" href='#_ftn87'>[87]</a> As Roger Allen has observed, it was this kind of writing by Chamberlain and other followers of Wagner with similar views that marked ‘a stage in the process through which late Wagnerian thought as defined in the prose writings flowed into a repellent Germanic ideology’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref88" href='#_ftn88'>[88]</a></p>
    <p>      Holbrooke certainly had no interest in promoting Germanness, and unlike Buckley and Boughton he did not subscribe to theories that proposed a blood brotherhood or kinship between various Germanic and North European races. Nonetheless, Holbrooke shared a certain attitude towards Jews and racial identity with the likes of Chamberlain and Wagner. This is not to say that Holbrooke was some kind of proto-Nazi, but when a work like <em>The Children of Don</em> is viewed through this lens, the regenerative dimension of the plot and its depiction of a Celtic race representative of an ur-Britishness appears rather sinister. It was an unfortunate coincidence and yet also somehow prescient that the picture on the front cover of the vocal score for <em>The Children of Don</em> (published 1912), designed by Sidney Sime (1865–1941), contained an image of a swastika etched onto the trilithon in the bottom right-hand corner of the page (Fig. 5.1).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref89" href='#_ftn89'>[89]</a> For Sime, of course, this was not a symbol of Nazism; he probably understood it as a Celtic symbol. As much as any other element of these works, it is the Celtic dimension of <em>Don</em> and <em>Dylan</em>, and especially their representations of Celtic nature that highlight their relationship with other works of British musical Wagnerism.</p>

    <h2>5.3 Celticism and Nature</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">The Celtic aspects of <em>The Cauldron of Annwn</em> trilogy and Holbrooke’s interest in Celticism more generally must be viewed through the lens of his ideas about race and nationalism. Like many artists of the period, Holbrooke was keen to highlight the Celtic elements of his ancestry. In his autobiography, for instance, he noted that his mother was ‘a Highland woman’ – meaning that he had ‘Scottish blood in [his] veins’ – and that his grandfather was born in Cardiff.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref90" href='#_ftn90'>[90]</a> Holbrooke also pointed out the Celtic origins of his collaborators on <em>Apollo and the Seaman</em> and the <em>Annwn</em> trilogy, Herbert Trench and Ellis. After praising the former’s ‘glorious fire in life’, for instance, Holbrooke exclaims ‘Give me the Celt! Being half Scotch, perhaps, I am one myself!’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref91" href='#_ftn91'>[91]</a></p>
    <p>Holbrooke’s desire to identify himself as a Celt might have stemmed from a belief that there was a strong link between ‘the Celts’ and artistic expression, a stereotype perpetuated by Matthew Arnold’s nineteenth-century descriptions of Celtic nature as feminine and sentimental.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref92" href='#_ftn92'>[92]</a> In this respect, Holbrooke distinguished between Celts and ‘Britons’ (which in this instance seems to have referred to the English), who are not generally inclined towards such expression:</p>
    <blockquote><p>Coming from the stage as I did, I often thought I might contribute some good operas to Britain’s meagre national library, but the Briton, generally, is not dramatic in expression, either in music or in life. But I was a Celt and that is a very different matter. The Celts have all the arts!&#8288;<a id="_ftnref93" href='#_ftn93'>[93]</a></p></blockquote>
    <p class="first-para-section">It was, however, principally a romanticised and idealistic notion of ‘the Celt’ which Holbrooke admired, for when it came to the actual people of Celtic nations the composer was rather less complimentary, writing that Scotland was not a great artistic nation,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref94" href='#_ftn94'>[94]</a> and criticising the ‘ineptitude’ of the Welsh ‘money-grubbing people’ when it came to ‘great art’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref95" href='#_ftn95'>[95]</a></p>
    <p>      While this might suggest that Holbrooke’s relationship with Celticism was merely superficial, Holbrooke’s experience of the Celtic world was actually far from imaginary. He spent a significant period of time in North Wales between 1906 and the 1930s, and he even wished to have his <em>Annwn</em> dramas produced in Wales, a plan thwarted only by the lack of an appropriate opera house in which to perform them.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref96" href='#_ftn96'>[96]</a> Holbrooke also introduced Ellis to North Wales in the summer of 1910 when they were driving through the country in search of sites referred to in the <em>Mabinogion</em>. It was this trip that ultimately inspired Ellis to purchase and refurbish Chirk Castle on the Welsh-English border.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref97" href='#_ftn97'>[97]</a> Anne-Marie Forbes notes that Ellis and Holbrooke ‘shared a romanticism of “Wild Wales”’, and their literary and compositional identities were both shaped by its natural surroundings as much as its mythology.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref98" href='#_ftn98'>[98]</a> Holbrooke himself wrote that the <em>Annwn</em> dramas were influenced by ‘the atmosphere of the land and the poetry [of Wales]’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref99" href='#_ftn99'>[99]</a> and as early as 1908 his music had already begun to draw musical inspiration from the Welsh environment.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref100" href='#_ftn100'>[100]</a> Around the same time, Holbrooke began to stay regularly in Harlech (North-West Wales), initially in a rented cottage named Hafod Wen, which was situated on the coast just outside the town and overlooked the sea.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref101" href='#_ftn101'>[101]</a> Bantock’s biographer H. Orsmond Anderton, who was also acquainted with Holbrooke, recalled witnessing the composer in his surroundings at Harlech: </p>
    <blockquote><p>He had until recently a house on a lovely part of the coast, above a sort of landslip, near Harlech. I remember climbing down from the road and prowling about till I came to a window at which this nature-spirit sat writing in solitude, with an entrancing view of coast, wood, sea, and distant mountains spread out before him, translating it all by his wizardry, in the alembic of his mind, into gorgeous sound-pictures. In these, his natural haunts, he revels as in his native element, bathing himself in the beauty of the lake, glen and moor […].&#8288;<a id="_ftnref102" href='#_ftn102'>[102]</a></p></blockquote>
    <p>      Although the landscapes and seascapes of North Wales were undoubtedly the principal source of inspiration for Holbrooke’s nature music in the <em>Annwn</em> trilogy,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref103" href='#_ftn103'>[103]</a> the composer travelled to various other Celtic regions and landmarks in order to capture the right mood, sometimes accompanied by his librettist, Ellis, or scene designer, Sime. Holbrooke apparently visited the Hebrides, for instance, to find inspiration for the wild-fowl music that is prominent in <em>Dylan</em> and to a lesser extent in <em>Don</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref104" href='#_ftn104'>[104]</a> Towards the end of 1908, the same time at which Holbrooke began composing the music for <em>Dylan</em>, he was in Penzance, Cornwall. From there he sent Bantock a postcard with a picture depicting ‘A Rough Sea off the English Coast’ (Fig. 5.2).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref105" href='#_ftn105'>[105]</a> It is not clear whether Sime or Ellis was with Holbrooke in Penzance, but Holbrooke certainly travelled with the former to Stonehenge on a different occasion to help them prepare the production of <em>Don</em>, and they viewed the monument in moonlight for full effect.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref106" href='#_ftn106'>[106]</a> That the creators of the <em>Don</em> and <em>Dylan</em> sought inspiration from all the Celtic corners of Britain demonstrates that despite the Welsh accent of the trilogy, Holbrooke, Ellis and Sime were also interested in a broader notion of Celticism – a pan-Celticism – that was not necessarily rooted in one nation. </p>

    <p>The Celticism of the <em>Annwn</em> operas should, then, be seen not just in context of Holbrooke’s own experience of the Celtic world but in relation to the larger group of works that form part of the Celtic strand of British musical Wagnerism. As demonstrated by Bantock’s <em>Caedmar</em>, MacCunn’s <em>Diarmid</em> and Elgar’s <em>Caractacus</em>, this Celtic Wagnerism had already appeared in British music of the 1890s, and it was associated with themes of regeneration (<em>Caractacus</em>), redemption (<em>Diarmid</em> and <em>Caedmar</em>) and enchanted representations of nature (<em>Caedmar</em> in particular). The dramas of <em>The Cauldron of Annwn</em> trilogy display aspects of all three of these themes, but it is the representation of nature in <em>Don</em> and <em>Dylan</em> that is particularly important in connection with these works’ Celticism and Wagnerism. The ‘forest murmurs’ scene in <em>Caedmar</em>, inspired by Wagner’s <em>Siegfried</em>, pointed to a vision of nature that was pantheistic, sublime and enchanted. But because this conception of nature was not threatening or disturbing, and did not seem to stem from any personal encounter with nature that Bantock had experienced, it did not quite fit into the ‘romantic, dystopian, and sublime’ conception of nature that Aidan Thomson has linked to the idea of the ‘Celtic North’. The ancient Celtic landscapes and seascapes of Wales that are central to <em>Don</em> and <em>Dylan</em>, however, embody all of the characteristics listed above. If we take the concept of the ‘Celtic North’ to mean not a specific geographical area but rather a particular aesthetic stance towards nature, then Holbrooke and Ellis’s dramas clearly fit into this category. Above all, this is because of the prominent role assigned to the sea in these works, especially in <em>Dylan</em>. </p>
    <p>Musical evocations of the sea were fundamental to the sublime and destructive idea of nature associated with the ‘Celtic North’ aesthetic, and a number of works written by British composers during the first two decades of the twentieth century depicted the sea in this way.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref107" href='#_ftn107'>[107]</a> Jennifer Oates has recently contrasted Bantock’s <em>Hebridean</em> Symphony, which she argues is an ‘expression of the “Celtic North”,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref108" href='#_ftn108'>[108]</a> with ‘the conquered oceans of Stanford, Vaughan Williams, Delius, Elgar, and others […] which emphasize tamed, rural nature’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref109" href='#_ftn109'>[109]</a> A similar distinction between what may be described as a disenchanted and a (re)enchanted sea in British music was posited by Ernest Newman in 1920. On the one hand, Newman argued, there was sea music that functioned simply as a ‘pretext for conventional decoration or for moral reference’ – Vaughan Williams’s <em>Sea Symphony</em>, Elgar’s <em>Sea Pictures</em> and Stanford’s collections of sea songs were included in this category. Newman thought that these works were ‘stiff and cumbrous’ or merely ‘beautiful’ or ‘jolly’. On the other hand was sea music such as Bantock’s <em>Hebridean</em> Symphony and Delius’s <em>Sea Drift</em> that expressed ‘the real sea sense: the sense of distance, of mystery, of loneliness, of fateful silence’. The real sea could be evoked musically through a ‘mood of solitude and sadness, turbulence and mystery’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref110" href='#_ftn110'>[110]</a></p>
    <p>It is significant that when Newman turned to non-British composers of ‘good sea-music’, he pointed not only to Debussy’s <em>La Mer</em>, but also to Wagner, whose overture to <em>Der fliegende Holländer</em> is cited as evidence of the German composer’s maritime credentials. Similarly, in a review praising the sea music of Bantock’s <em>Hebridean</em> Symphony three years earlier, Newman drew attention to that work’s similarities with Wagner’s <em>Tristan</em> to help him explain the ‘mystery and mournfulness and luring romance of the sea’ depicted by Bantock’s symphony.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref111" href='#_ftn111'>[111]</a> In fact, Wagner, and <em>Tristan</em> in particular, constitutes the link between a number of British works that evoke a mysterious and untameable Celtic sea. In addition to the musical similarities Newman noted in Bantock’s work, Smyth’s <em>The Wreckers</em> alludes to <em>Tristan</em> through its Cornish setting and tragic love story which culminates with a pair of lovers being drowned by the sea, and Bax’s <em>Tintagel</em> quotes a motif from <em>Tristan</em> and alludes to its story and Cornish sea-setting in various other ways (see Chapter 6). The importance of the <em>Tristan</em> influence in these works was no coincidence, for Wagner’s music drama provided the key reference point for an association between a Celtic sea, death, love and redemption.</p>
    <p>      That Holbrooke, too, understood the importance of the Celtic element of <em>Tristan</em> is demonstrated by a review he wrote of a Covent Garden production of <em>Tristan</em> in 1911, using the pseudonym ‘The Raven’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref112" href='#_ftn112'>[112]</a> After criticising the American soprano who sang the part of Isolde for lacking the ‘proud fierceness’ that he considered characteristic of ‘all real Irishwomen’, Holbrooke proclaimed that ‘Wagner did a most unparalleled thing when he wrote “Tristan”’:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>For a Teuton to express the Celtic solitude and yearning loneliness, was something only possible to a man of Wagner’s genius, and for that reason we shall never have a decent performance of ‘Tristan’ in England until we have an Irish Isolde and a Celtic Tristan and an orchestra conducted by someone of true Celtic feeling. […] It’s an artistic blunder to give it to Germans. […]</p>
      <p>I think Nietzsche was right when he said Wagner was a misunderstanding among Germans. His music has too much Celtic feeling in it to be really congenial to Teutons. Hence their eager, somewhat forced enthusiasm for his works. One always feels like that over something that one cannot quite understand but knows one ought to appreciate.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref113" href='#_ftn113'>[113]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The above passage illustrates Holbrooke’s somewhat awkward attempt to Britishise Wagner while at the same time avoiding any suggestion of an Anglo-Celtic-Teutonic brotherhood. Wagner had to be depicted as an exception to the rule (that Teutons cannot understand Celtic feeling) in order to maintain a distance between the Anglo-Celtic world and ‘Teutons’, whom Holbrooke, of course, regarded as foreign ‘aliens’. In this way, Wagner was moulded into a more acceptable model for British composers, such as Holbrooke himself, to follow.</p>
    <p>      The passage quoted above is also striking because the words Holbrooke uses to describe the Celtic atmosphere of <em>Tristan</em> – ‘solitude’ and ‘loneliness’ – are the same as those used by Newman some years later to describe the ‘real sea’ music of Bantock and Wagner. The atmosphere of <em>Don</em> and <em>Dylan</em>, conjured up equally by text, music and staging, was often described in similarly stark adjectives to try to communicate a sense of the Celtic ‘elemental character’ of the stories, as Ellis described it.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref114" href='#_ftn114'>[114]</a> In addition to ‘elemental’ and ‘primeval’ – words which many critics, as well as Holbrooke himself,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref115" href='#_ftn115'>[115]</a> used to describe <em>Don</em> and <em>Dylan</em> – the words which appeared most frequently in the reception of these works included ‘dark’, ‘barbaric’, ‘sombre’, ‘austere’, ‘primitive’, ‘mysterious’, ‘stormy’, ‘wild’ and ‘savage’. One critic referred to <em>Don</em>’s ‘atmosphere of Cimmerian gloom’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref116" href='#_ftn116'>[116]</a></p>
    <p>In the case of <em>Don</em> at least, such assessments of the work were in part a consequence of the dim lighting at the premiere, which drew many complaints. One magazine reported that the opera was ‘performed in almost total darkness—as if the people of mythology only went forth into the world at twilight’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref117" href='#_ftn117'>[117]</a> But it was not just poor lighting that triggered these responses; Holbrooke’s musical evocations of the misty and tempestuous Celtic natural world depicted in Ellis’s texts also played an important role. In <em>Dylan</em> it is mainly the music associated with the sea and the flight of the wild-fowl (who are themselves a kind of extension of the sea) that evokes the sometimes wild and sometimes mysterious Celtic North aesthetic. John Runciman, writing in the <em>Saturday Review</em>, claimed that this music was the best of the opera: ‘the sea roars and the sea-wind wails, and the wild picture of a stormy day is perfect’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref118" href='#_ftn118'>[118]</a> The wild-fowl music as it first appears in <em>Dylan</em>, towards the end of Act I is shown in Ex. 5.2. At this point in the opera the soft dynamics, fast tempo and chromaticism of this music evoke a mysterious and nervous atmosphere depicting the sea-birds in flight. At the end of the first act, however, this theme is stated with the full fury of the revenge-seeking sea as the wild-fowl chorus promises to pass on news of Dylan’s murder to the Sea-King. The chorus sings a version of the ‘Dylan’ motif over the orchestra’s ‘wild-fowl’ motif, which merges into the related ‘wave’ motif at fig. 147 (highlighting the synonymy of the birds and the sea), before a final cadence brings the act to a close (Ex. 5.3).</p>

    <p>      While there is nothing overtly Wagnerian about this particular sea music, there are various musical allusions to Wagner in <em>Don</em> and <em>Dylan</em> that reveal not just surface similarities but deeper connections with <em>Tristan</em> and the <em>Ring</em>, particularly in relation to representations of nature. Contemporary critics observed a number of these Wagnerian allusions, including an apparent reference to King Marke’s music from Act II of <em>Tristan</em> in Math’s dying speech in Act III of <em>Don</em>; a general resemblance in character between Wagner’s stormy ‘Ride of the Valkyries’ and the demon music in Act II of <em>Don</em>; and a motif reminiscent of one heard at the end of <em>Tristan</em>’s ‘Liebestod’ at the start of the final act of <em>Don</em> (Ex. 5.4).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref119" href='#_ftn119'>[119]</a></p>
    <p>In the latter case, the music of <em>Tristan</em> that the critic was referring to is the falling four-note figure, which generally begins with an accented appoggiatura and follows a quaver-quaver-dotted quaver-semiquaver rhythm, that accompanies Isolde in the final pages of the drama. This is in fact the same music that Bantock drew on at the end of <em>Caedmar</em> for its associations with transcendence and redemption (see Ex. 3.10 in Chapter 3). In <em>Don</em> and <em>Dylan</em> this motif and others that are related to it appear in numerous guises and in various dramatic contexts. The motifs of both Goewin and Govannion, for example, are similar, and, consequently, the falling four-note motif is often linked to love or passion more generally. Similar musical figures also appear during sections featuring the Sea-King in both <em>Don</em> and <em>Dylan</em> (see, for instance, the music between figs. 31 and 32:4 towards the end of the prologue of <em>Don</em>). Most significantly, a more chromatic version of this motif appears at one of the climactic moments of <em>Dylan</em>, when in the final scene Govannion is drowned by the violent waters summoned by the Sea-King (Ex. 5.5). Another version of the motif, still containing the characteristic accented dissonant note at the start, continues to be heard in the pages following Govannion’s death while Gwyddno laments the destruction wrought by the gods. It would seem, then, that Holbrooke chose to use this motif not just for its associations with passion but also for its connection with the sea and in particular with the destructive Celtic sea of <em>Tristan</em>, an association established in Wagner’s work through the fact that the motif accompanies the transfiguring Isolde singing of sinking and drowning. Holbrooke thus transforms Wagner’s metaphorical and transcendent waves of redemption at the climax of Isolde’s ‘Liebestod’ into the violent Celtic waters which literally drown Govannion at the end of <em>Dylan</em>.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The music of the opening of the overture to <em>Don</em> also suggests a Wagnerian parallel: the prelude to Act III of <em>Siegfried</em> (Exx. 5.6 and 5.7). Both begin in G minor with an ascending, two-bar dotted figure in the bass repeated a number of times and accompanied by broken-chord dotted figurations above the bass. The orchestration of this music is also similar in <em>Don</em> and <em>Siegfried</em>, with the dotted ascending motifs in the bass of each example played initially by the double basses, bassoons and bass clarinets, and the broken chords above it played by the other strings, suggesting a scene emerging out of a murky, elemental mist. Holbrooke might have chosen this part of <em>Siegfried</em> as a model due to the similarities between the scenes that each introduction precedes: in Act III of <em>Siegfried</em>, a rocky mountain on a stormy night, and in the prologue of <em>Don</em>, a rocky, misty cavern in the ‘northern isles’. Moreover, when Holbrooke uses the same music at the start of the second scene of the prologue, to introduce Don, the nature goddess, there are clear parallels with the summoning of Erda, the earth goddess, at the start of the final act of <em>Siegfried</em>. The discussion of this music in the programme for <em>Don</em> noted that Holbrooke had named his opening motif ‘primeval energy’ and ‘Nature’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref120" href='#_ftn120'>[120]</a> There is a broader parallel with the <em>Ring</em>, then, which opens in <em>Das Rheingold</em> with another ascending motif representing primal nature, from which all else evolves.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Another musical allusion to the <em>Ring</em> appears in this overture at fig. 3:4 and again at fig. 8 where the music strongly resembles the so-called ‘magic-fire’ motif of <em>Die Walküre</em> (Ex. 5.8). Like Wagner’s motif, Holbrooke’s music employs a double-dotted chord, alternating with a chromatic neighbouring chord, which is accompanied by staccato arpeggiations in higher registers. The effect is similar to that engendered by Wagner’s music: a brief, glistening moment of harmonic stasis that is perhaps in <em>Don</em>’s case associated with the fire of the cauldron which features in the following prologue. Although all these allusions might seem only fleeting and insignificant, they reveal that the Celtic, elemental nature aesthetic of the <em>Annwn</em> dramas owes a debt to the pantheistic current of Wagnerism that stemmed from Wagner’s <em>Ring</em> and <em>Tristan</em>.</p>

    </div>

    <p>In addition to the music, Sime’s scene designs for <em>Don</em> and <em>Dylan</em> contributed to the perception of the primitive and elemental Celtic character of these dramas. A number of these scenes were evidently inspired by Holbrooke and Sime’s excursions to Celtic regions and monuments: in addition to the stark cavern of the prologue and the enchanted forest that forms the backdrop of Act I, there was a fully-formed stone circle in Act II and a rocky sea-shore with waves crashing against the rocks for Act III, rather resembling the image on Holbrooke’s 1908 postcard sent from Penzance (Figs. 5.2 and 5.3). The effort that went in to producing these designs is typical of the archaeological approach that Holbrooke and his collaborators took in producing <em>Don</em> and to some degree <em>Dylan</em>, too, in which Sime’s design for Gwyddno’s Castle in Act I (Fig. 5.4) resembled Ellis’s real-life Chirk Castle.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref121" href='#_ftn121'>[121]</a> The costumes, jewellery and armour for <em>Don</em> were similarly precise in historical detail, and their designer, W. G. Johnson, was reportedly a Welsh archaeologist (drawings of the costumes for Gwydion, Math, Goewin and Elan are shown in Fig. 5.5).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref122" href='#_ftn122'>[122]</a></p>

    <p>This archaeological attitude manifested to a lesser extent in the music of the <em>Annwn</em> trilogy, which occasionally uses folk song. Folk music (mainly Welsh but also some Irish) is used most extensively in the final drama, <em>Bronwen</em>, but it also features in <em>Don</em> following the death of Math where the Welsh tune known as ‘Morfa Rhuddlan’ (Rhuddlan Marsh) is heard (Ex. 5.9).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref123" href='#_ftn123'>[123]</a> In the 1930s Holbrooke recalled that he ‘did much travelling in Old Wales to get some of the magnificent folk songs around these Dramas’, and he described discovering one of these folk songs – possibly ‘Morfa Rhuddlan’ – in a pub in Blaenau Ffestiniog, accompanied by Sime and the painter Augustus John.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref124" href='#_ftn124'>[124]</a> The sections that use folk song in <em>Don</em>, however, constitute only a tiny proportion of the music as a whole. It is notable, then, that multiple reviews of the opera described the music after the death of Math as one of the highlights of the work, while criticising much of the rest of it.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref125" href='#_ftn125'>[125]</a></p>

    </div>

    <p>Although Holbrooke incorporated folk music into his trilogy, he never really embraced folk music seriously. Holbrooke’s attitude towards folk music was like that of other post-Wagnerians, such as Bax and Boughton, who aimed more often to capture the spirit of folk music rather than quote it directly (though they all did on occasion). In his book <em>Contemporary British Composers</em> Holbrooke stated that ‘The use of folk-song in itself will not give us a native style’, echoing Boughton’s remarks that a school of British composers would not be created by dressing up folk songs.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref126" href='#_ftn126'>[126]</a> Moreover, Holbrooke seems to have resented Vaughan Williams and the musical aesthetic he represented: Watt writes that in <em>Contemporary British Composers</em> Holbrooke ignored Vaughan Williams’s pastoralism altogether, and his attitude towards him was ‘lukewarm’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref127" href='#_ftn127'>[127]</a> In letters to Bantock in the mid-1920s he complained of the ‘Holst-Williams circus’, which he saw ‘nothing about’, and expressed his sense of injustice that ‘the work JH has no chance at present – while “Sea Symphonies” are played by every society’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref128" href='#_ftn128'>[128]</a></p>
    <p>To return to the staging of <em>Don</em> and <em>Dylan</em>, while the scenery was mostly of a painted realistic kind, there was a significant innovation in the staging of <em>Dylan</em>: the chorus of sea-fowl was depicted visually by the means of moving images projected by a cinematograph – one of the earliest instances of such technology being used in an operatic production. Rob Barnett suggests that the film was made by the British cinematographer Will Barker (1868–1951), and that it might have been captured at St. Kilda, an archipelago located at the far west of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland which is home to many kinds of seabird.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref129" href='#_ftn129'>[129]</a> A number of reports from the time, however, contradict this, stating instead that the film was made at Bass Rock, a small island just off the south-east coast of Scotland which is occupied by a colony of gannets.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref130" href='#_ftn130'>[130]</a> In any case, the choice to go to Scotland to film the footage is yet another example of Holbrooke and his collaborators’ desire to create an authentically Celtic backdrop and Celtic representation of nature for their trilogy. Either the isolation of St. Kilda or the harsh, rugged appearance of Bass Rock, then, would have proved suitable for the film and complemented the ‘primal’, ‘elemental’ atmosphere that critics identified in all aspects of the trilogy. </p>
    <p>Peter Washtell has suggested a parallel between Holbrooke’s use of the chorus to represent the wild-fowl, wind and waves and Boughton’s dancing scenery, even stating that Holbrooke ‘anticipated’ Boughton’s use of the chorus as scenery. Given that Boughton’s first experiment with this concept took place in 1913 – <em>before</em> the premiere of <em>Dylan</em> – it seems likely that, if there is an element of influence, it moved in the opposite direction.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref131" href='#_ftn131'>[131]</a> In any case, the similarities are only superficial. Whereas Boughton was attempting to out-Wagner Wagner through a fusion of poetry, music, dance and scene through one vessel, the human body, Holbrooke’s use of the cinematograph had the opposite effect of isolating music from movement, particularly as the wild-fowl chorus was supposed to be invisible, offstage. Moreover, Holbrooke’s moving scenery is not symbolic of emotions and ‘religious’ ideas as Boughton’s was supposed to be; rather, it is a realistic depiction of wild sea birds. The wild-fowl are symbolic, however, of a kind of pantheistic notion of the sea and nature more generally. </p>
    <h2>5.4 Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">Wagner had already made a bird speak in <em>Siegfried</em>, and Bantock had attempted to imitate this magical natural world with his own wood bird in <em>Caedmar</em>. Holbrooke took this Celtic pantheistic strand of Wagnerism a step further in <em>Don</em> and <em>Dylan</em> by giving voice to a whole flock of sea-birds and by providing a literal representation of the Celtic wildlife through the use of cutting-edge technology. Holbrooke’s dramas demonstrate that although the idea of the ‘Celtic North’ in music has been linked to a rejection of mythology,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref132" href='#_ftn132'>[132]</a> a wild, untamed and enchanted representation of nature could and did also go hand in hand with works founded on <em>Ring</em>-like legends. Far from being opposed to Wagnerism, the ‘Celtic North’ aesthetic in British music of the early twentieth century emerged in part <em>from</em> Wagner and in particular from <em>Tristan</em> and the <em>Ring</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref133" href='#_ftn133'>[133]</a></p>
    <p>      Holbrooke’s Celticism was somewhat unusual among British composers, however, in being located deep in Wales rather than engaging with the more common Scottish, Irish and Cornish manifestations of the movement. As noted in Chapter 1, Parry’s <em>Guenever</em> was set on the Welsh border, and the Severnside region provided settings or inspiration for many composers associated with the English Musical Renaissance. British Wagnerian composers, however, appear to have been more inclined to cross over the borders and immerse themselves more fully in the Celtic mist. Broadly speaking, then, these composers were more concerned with notions of Britishness than Englishness, though like most people of the time they still used these terms interchangeably or in an ambiguous manner. In essence, the appeal of Celticism to Holbrooke was the same as it was for many other British composers: the Celtic world offered a source of enchantment that could act as a corrective to the disenchanted English world. As David Martin observes, ‘Celtic cultures had the appeal of proto-nations full of pre-capitalist vitality which meant they could provide an artistic alias for English artists and musicians repelled by Protestant utilitarianism’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref134" href='#_ftn134'>[134]</a> But for someone possessing Holbrooke’s ideas about race and nationality, the Celts also represented a form of racial purity that had been diluted in modern times. If, then, there were only ever a few steps between the more benign idealistic notion of regeneration expressed in Tennyson’s <em>Idylls</em> and something much more sinister, Holbrooke’s trilogy illustrates how the convergence of Celticism, nationalism and Wagnerism could bridge the gap.</p>
    <p>By the time the last part of <em>The Cauldron of Annwn</em>, <em>Bronwen</em>, was performed in the provinces in 1929 it was seen as an anachronism.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref135" href='#_ftn135'>[135]</a> After the First World War, the idea that British music of the future would be found in the emulation of Wagnerian music drama was largely abandoned. British composers who were unable to move on from a world of Wagnerian and post-Wagnerian music and aesthetics after 1920 fell into obscurity sooner or later. This is illustrated by the careers of Holbrooke’s associates who, like Holbrooke himself, did not alter their compositional technique in any significant way: Wallace disappeared from the public compositional arena altogether around this time; Bantock, who continued to work in a late-romantic style, was increasingly regarded as insignificant as a composer, despite being well respected; and Boughton clung on to fame for only a little while longer due to the success of <em>The Immortal Hour</em>, and although his musical style underwent changes, he remained committed to his Arthurian choral dramas until his death. One notable exception was Arnold Bax. Like the other composers of the RAM-Midlands group, Bax initially embraced the world of Wagner-esque mythology, composed in a post-Wagnerian style and was involved in the Celtic phenomenon. Bax’s Celticism went a step beyond that of the other composers considered here, however, in that, for him, the Celtic world was no longer just a source for the rejuvenation of Britain, but a separate world that required its own regeneration that would take place not in tandem with, but through detachment from, the rest of modern Britain. Moreover, Bax was more successful in shedding his (post-)Wagnerian skin after the First World War by embracing a new kind of musical style and aesthetic stance that would eventually converge with British Sibelianism. One of Bax’s works that stands on the threshold of this shift, his tone poem <em>Tintagel</em>, thus functions as an ideal case study illustrating the twilight of Wagnerism in British music.∎</p>

      <p><a id="_ftn32" href='#_ftnref32'>[32]</a> This was composed as a set-piece in part because Ellis wrote the text for this section to suggest such a setting, but probably also musically to distance Nodens, the dreaming god in the clouds, from the rest of the characters in the drama.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn33" href='#_ftnref33'>[33]</a> Anne-Marie Forbes has demonstrated how Holbrooke used leitmotifs to represent musically the idea of metempsychosis which Ellis drew on when writing <em>Bronwen</em>: in the drama certain characters, emotions and situations are reincarnations or cyclical repetitions of events from the previous two dramas of the trilogy. Forbes writes that ‘it is apparent that in composing the score of <em>Bronwen</em>, Holbrooke has expanded upon the metaphysical reasonings of Ellis, indicating by musical quotations not only the reincarnated characters as devised by Ellis, but also instances where the passion that dominates one character might shape the actions of another’.

      <p><a id="_ftn38" href='#_ftnref38'>[38]</a> Paul Rodmell has recently identified various Wagnerian tendencies in the music of Holbrooke’s earlier chamber opera <em>Pierrot and Pierrette</em> (1908). These include a reliance ‘on the repetition and variation of motifs to provide a wider sense of structural unity’; a ‘meandering harmonic language’ involving ‘frequent evaded cadence points, successive seventh chords, and alternations between major and minor modes’; the use of ‘<em>arioso</em> sections, to avoid regular four bar phrases, sentences and periods, in order to engender a more continuous musical flow’; and the role of the orchestra ‘as commentator on the stage action’.

The complete <em>Cauldron of Annwn</em> libretto published by Ellis in 1922 contains numerous additions which were not set to music when <em>Don</em> was performed in 1912. The 1922 version includes, for instance a long written prelude before the prologue which is narrated by the Winds, Waves and Wild-Fowl. There is no evidence, however, that Ellis intended Holbrooke to use this prelude as inspiration for his musical overture, in the way that Buckley created a verbal orchestra for his collaboration with Boughton.

In 1940 Holbrooke told William Wallace that Vaughan Williams was not ‘in our class’ and that ‘V W was so much appreciated it was obvious he had nothing new to say’. Quoted in Craik, ‘Friendship with Granville Bantock’, 32. Holbrooke’s aversion to Vaughan Williams’s music was symptomatic of the attitude of many of the British composers who worked mainly in a Wagnerian or post-Wagnerian idiom. This group often adopted an outsider mentality and resented Parry and Stanford in particular, a mistrust that sometimes extended to Parry and Stanford’s students at the RCM. See Chapter 3 for examples of Bantock and Wallace’s contempt for Parry and Stanford. That this animosity might have extended to the younger generation or RCM composers is indicated, for example, by Wallace’s remark in 1904 that ‘the Royal College of Music is associated with a certain phase of thought which is academically antagonistic, if not openly inimical, to every modern tendency. […] We want British music not Royal-College-of-Music music’. William Wallace, ‘The Royal College of Music and the Palmer Fund’, <em>The Times</em>, 30 May 1904, 3.</p>
