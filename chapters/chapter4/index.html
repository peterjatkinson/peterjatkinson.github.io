    <h1>CHAPTER 4</h1>
    <h1>Boughton, The Perfect Wagnerite</h1>
    <p class="first-para-section dropcap">In 1911 Rutland Boughton and Reginald R. Buckley published a short book outlining their vision for a new kind of music drama. They called it ‘choral drama’ and at the back of their manifesto was the libretto for the first of these dramas, entitled <em>Uther and Igraine</em> (later renamed <em>The Birth of Arthur</em>). The publication’s self-consciously Wagnerian title, <em>Music-Drama of the Future</em>, reflected its authors’ equally intentional ‘continuation of the German master’s drama’, to which they were ‘greatly indebted’ but which in their view had also ‘failed thoroughly to achieve’ what their planned cycle of Arthurian choral dramas would.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref2" href='#_ftn2'>[2]</a> While the pair’s ambitious plans to build a theatre in which to perform their dramas, and to construct an agricultural commune around it,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref3" href='#_ftn3'>[3]</a> never fully materialised, they did lead to a series of festivals held in Glastonbury between 1914 and 1927.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref4" href='#_ftn4'>[4]</a></p>
    <p> In the fourth edition of <em>The Perfect Wagnerite</em> George Bernard Shaw described these festivals as ‘Little Bayreuth’, and their organiser, Boughton, as a ‘Perfect Wagnerite’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref5" href='#_ftn5'>[5]</a> In Shaw’s view, the Glastonbury festivals and Boughton had earned their respective titles not because the festival was dedicated to performances of Wagner – which it was not – and not because the music performed there was Wagnerian in nature (which it was not always). Rather, realising the ‘Wagnerist dream’ in England meant that ‘the English soil should produce English music and English drama, and that English people should perform them in their own way’. As this chapter will demonstrate, there was far more to Boughton’s Wagnerism than this, though the nationalistic dimension of his work and his attempts to involve ‘the people’ in the productions given at Glastonbury were important parts of the project which will be explored here. First, this chapter will explain how Boughton’s collaboration with Buckley came about; it will explore the influences and ideas that underpinned Boughton’s Wagnerism, his work at Glastonbury and his choral dramas; and it will examine the extent to which Wagner influenced the libretto, music and staging of <em>The Birth of Arthur</em>, drawing on a study of the unpublished manuscript score of the work and photographs illustrating Boughton’s so-called ‘dancing scenery’ – an innovation whereby dancers would act out realistic settings and symbolic ideas through movement and gesture.</p>
    <p>Boughton was an unlikely candidate to become England’s ‘Perfect Wagnerite’. Born into a lower-middle class family, he was unable, due to lack of funds, to study music at a conservatoire until he was twenty-one years of age, in 1899.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref6" href='#_ftn6'>[6]</a> Moreover, when he did enter a conservatoire, it was not the Royal Academy of Music, where most of the other British Wagnerites of his generation had trained, but the Royal College of Music, where he studied until 1901.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref7" href='#_ftn7'>[7]</a> Nonetheless, Boughton resisted Stanford’s attempts ‘to make him a virtuous imitator of Brahms’, and Michael Hurd, Boughton’s biographer, notes that the composer’s early works, such as the Symphony No. 1, <em>Oliver Cromwell</em> (1904–5), leant ‘heavily on Wagner’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref8" href='#_ftn8'>[8]</a> Boughton’s interest in Cromwell also indicates the other subject, besides music, that would dominate his life: politics.</p>
    <p>      In addition to being the only member of the RAM-Midlands group to study at the RCM, Boughton was also the only British Wagnerian composer whose Wagnerism was shaped in a significant way by G. B. Shaw’s socialist interpretation of the <em>Ring</em> in <em>The Perfect Wagnerite</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref9" href='#_ftn9'>[9]</a> At the same time as Boughton and Buckley began to promote their Arthurian cycle, the influence of Shaw on Boughton’s writings and lectures on Wagner also became more prominent. Boughton and Shaw, who frequently corresponded with each other from 1908,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref10" href='#_ftn10'>[10]</a> shared left-wing politics, and it was this commonality of political ideas that accounted for the appeal of Shaw’s <em>The Perfect Wagnerite</em> to Boughton. Like Shaw, or perhaps because of Shaw, Boughton believed that the ideas expressed in the <em>Ring</em> were those ‘that were agitating the modern political and social world’, and that the force of socialism ran throughout the cycle.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref11" href='#_ftn11'>[11]</a> In a series of articles he wrote on the tetralogy during 1910–11 Boughton set out these dramas’ relevance to the modern world, directing readers to ‘Shaw’s delightful book’ for more details: </p>
    <p>Wagner’s four dramas based upon the Saga of the Volsungs are in a very special way the spiritual expression of the century just over; and in no small degree prophetic of the century just begun. Vast commercial developments with all their advantages and all their evils, general bewilderment as to what wealth really is, an increasing sense of class-consciousness, and a general feeling of discomfort (in all classes) arising therefrom, a reaction towards what is natural common-sense in Paganism, and away from what is supernatural nonsense in Ecclesiastical Christianity, new adjustments in the relations between the sexes—these are the ideas which rose in the last century, and are blossoming now; and these are the ideas which were the inspiring force in Wagner’s <em>Ring</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref12" href='#_ftn12'>[12]</a></p>
    <p>Shaw’s interpretation of the <em>Ring</em> contributed to shaping not only Boughton and Buckley’s understanding of Wagner but also the vision for their own music dramas. Thus, when Boughton published an article entitled ‘The Wagnerian Ideal’ in 1911 and again made reference to Shaw’s ‘splendid little book on Wagner’, he was really setting out the case for his and Buckley’s ‘ideal’: that drama should bear a ‘direct relation to modern life as it is lived’ and that it should be guided by what he described as ‘religious’ ideas, such as ‘love, revenge, justice, honour, self-sacrifice, self-realization, obedience, revolt’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref13" href='#_ftn13'>[13]</a></p>
    <p>      In their first choral drama, <em>The Birth of Arthur</em>, Buckley and Boughton attempted to put these ideals, along with various other Wagnerian techniques and ideas, into practice. The inception of <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> dates to 1904, when Buckley began to write an Arthurian ‘national drama’ along the ‘the lines of Wagner’s “Ring”’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref14" href='#_ftn14'>[14]</a> By 1906 Buckley had completed his drama, <em>Arthur of Britain</em>, which was made up of four parts, originally entitled <em>Uther and Igraine</em>, <em>The Round Table</em>, <em>The Holy Grail</em>, and <em>The Death of Arthur</em>. Buckley had wanted Elgar to set the text to music, but Elgar was apparently too busy working on <em>The Kingdom</em>. The libretto was then sent to Bantock who also rejected it but recommended Boughton. Bantock had brought Boughton into his circle in 1905 when he offered the younger composer a teaching job at the Midlands Institute (just as he had done for Holbrooke a few years earlier; see Chapter 5).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref15" href='#_ftn15'>[15]</a> After reading <em>Arthur of Britain</em> in 1907, Boughton, who had already been planning to produce a music drama on a similar subject, agreed to collaborate with Buckley. The libretto for the first drama, <em>Uther and Igraine</em>, was first published as part of Boughton and Buckley’s <em>Music-Drama of the Future</em>, and subsequently published in a separate booklet, under its new title of <em>The Birth of Arthur</em>, in 1914, a year which also saw the publication of the complete text of <em>Arthur of Britain</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref16" href='#_ftn16'>[16]</a></p>
    <p>      According to Michael Hurd, Boughton composed all of the music for <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> between 1908 and 1909. The work has a complicated performance history, however, and it was only heard in its entirety over a decade after its completion, though various excerpts of the drama were performed in the intervening years.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref17" href='#_ftn17'>[17]</a> The launch of the Glastonbury festivals in 1914 did not immediately lead to a premiere of <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> – only excerpts of it were heard at Glastonbury in 1914 and 1915.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref18" href='#_ftn18'>[18]</a> The premiere of the whole work eventually took place at the 1920 festival on 16 August, and the drama was produced three times at the 1925 festival.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref19" href='#_ftn19'>[19]</a> The work was never performed in full again, and even in the 1920 and 1925 productions there was only a piano accompaniment – in part because of the limited space in the Glastonbury Assembly Rooms where the performances took place, but also due to the fact that Boughton never completed the orchestration.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref20" href='#_ftn20'>[20]</a> A complete vocal score survives in the British Library, and it is from this score that the extended musical examples given in Appendix II and referred to in this chapter have been transcribed.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref21" href='#_ftn21'>[21]</a></p>
    <p>There are a number of reasons why this work, more than Boughton’s immensely successful <em>The Immortal Hour</em> or any of Boughton’s other music dramas, should form the focus of this study. First, it is the drama in which Boughton most clearly put into practice the Wagnerian theories that he and Buckley had developed in their published writings. Second, it is the only Arthurian drama on which Boughton and the equally Wagnerian Buckley really worked together on their shared vision (Boughton made substantial changes to the libretto of <em>The Round Table</em> and later abandoned Buckley’s work). Third, the musical style of <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> is more Wagnerian, or at least post-Wagnerian, than any of Boughton’s other dramas. Finally, the surviving photographs of the choreography of the dancing scenery in an early partial performance of <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> allow for an examination of one of the most innovative aspects of Boughton’s reinvention of the <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em>. Before examining this choral drama, however, it is first necessary to briefly consider Boughton’s ideas about the constituent arts of music drama and their union in the <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em>, as articulated in his published writings.</p>
    <h2>4.1 Boughton’s <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em></h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">Boughton’s earliest writings, dating from the late 1890s, illustrate his interest in theorising the relationships between the arts and placing them in a hierarchy,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref22" href='#_ftn22'>[22]</a> and by 1901 he had begun to express an interest in the idea of the <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em>, writing that music should be combined with the ‘art of Action’ (dance and gesture) and the ‘art of Speech’ (poetry) to form music drama.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref23" href='#_ftn23'>[23]</a> Over the next decade Boughton repeatedly returned to the subject of the interrelations between the arts, gradually refining his ideas until their clearest explication in <em>Music-Drama of the Future</em>. Though he never lost a conviction that music was the ‘art of arts’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref24" href='#_ftn24'>[24]</a> the standard by which the other arts were judged,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref25" href='#_ftn25'>[25]</a> his belief that art should have an ethical dimension and be democratic in nature led him to believe that music, poetry and dance were ineffective without the help of each other. Following Wagner’s arguments in <em>The Artwork of the Future</em> (1849), Boughton explained in a 1911 lecture that each art had become useless by itself: gesture or dance had become a ‘vulgar and indecent thing’, poetry had become ‘just a question of word-spinning’ and absolute music failed to deal with ‘real life’ because of its abstraction. Wagner had been the first to recognise, Boughton claimed, that the time had come to reunite these arts in drama.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref26" href='#_ftn26'>[26]</a> In <em>Music-Drama of the Future</em> Boughton referred to dance, poetry and music as the ‘physical’, ‘intellectual’ and ‘emotional’ ‘appeals’ of drama, and argued that poetry alone could only appeal to the cold ‘observations and calculation’ of the ‘intellect’; it was music that contributed ‘feelings of mystery and wonder and beauty’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref27" href='#_ftn27'>[27]</a></p>
    <p>      In addition to Boughton’s Wagnerian ideas about the union of the arts, there were three key elements of his theory of choral drama which were repeated in his writings, and which could have been inspired by Wagner. First was his belief that music drama had to be inspired by real-life experience, that it should be an ‘expression of modern life as it is lived’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref28" href='#_ftn28'>[28]</a> Second, Boughton argued that music drama should be ‘religious’. Boughton explains that his use of this word did not refer to ideas ‘gained from bibles or priests’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref29" href='#_ftn29'>[29]</a> but rather the meaning of this word in Boughton’s writings was usually synonymous with ‘ethical’ and related to a deeply-held belief in some ‘ideal’ that was to be ‘thoroughly <em>lived</em>’ and which gave ‘meaning to the life of its possessor’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref30" href='#_ftn30'>[30]</a> ‘Religious’ ideas or ideals were also linked by Boughton to the ‘wonder at the mystery’ ‘beyond the actuality of life’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref31" href='#_ftn31'>[31]</a> and to human ‘feelings’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref32" href='#_ftn32'>[32]</a> As he regarded music as ‘the clearest and most direct utterance of feeling’ (as did Bantock and Wallace), it was ideally suited to expressing these religious ideas.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref33" href='#_ftn33'>[33]</a> The final persistent theme in Boughton’s writings about music drama was the idea that drama should always arise from the spirit of, and be for, ‘the people’. Consequently, Boughton’s <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em>, like Wagner’s, was not only founded on ideas about the union of the arts but also concerned with wider socio-political aims and beliefs. </p>
    <h3>4.1.1 The Libretto</h3>
    <p class="first-para-section">As Roger Savage has recently argued, Buckley, no less than Boughton, ‘qualifies […] for consideration as at least <em>a</em>, if not <em>the</em>, Perfect Wagnerite’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref34" href='#_ftn34'>[34]</a> As Buckley explained in his contribution to <em>Music-Drama of the Future</em>, after hearing a performance of <em>Tannhäuser</em> early in the twentieth century he became a fully-fledged Wagnerite, not only attending productions of all of Wagner’s other dramas but also reading Ashton Ellis’s translations of Wagner’s prose writings.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref35" href='#_ftn35'>[35]</a> Savage lists a number of features of <em>Arthur of Britain</em>, and <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> in particular, where there are clear parallels with Wagner:</p>
    <p>The ‘Lake of Wonder’ evoked in the [in the prelude to Act I] permeates <em>Arthur</em> in a Rhine-like way. The shattering of the presumptuous Uther’s sword in <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> recalls Siegmund’s sword and Wotan’s spear being shattered in <em>The Valkyrie</em> and <em>Siegfried</em>; and the encounter between Uther and Igraine which leads to Arthur’s conception, though not a matter of incest, is more reminiscent of the first act of <em>The Valkyrie</em> than it is of the first book of Malory.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref36" href='#_ftn36'>[36]</a></p>
    <p>The setting of Act II of <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> in Tintagel, which Buckley and Boughton visited during their collaboration on the work,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref37" href='#_ftn37'>[37]</a> further highlights the work’s Wagnerian connections through the link with <em>Tristan</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref38" href='#_ftn38'>[38]</a> More generally, by creating a drama in four parts that traces the conception, life and death of a hero, Buckley revealed himself to be under the influence of the <em>Ring</em>, and he even remarked in 1911 that ‘Siegfried, the hero, is Germany’s King Arthur’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref39" href='#_ftn39'>[39]</a></p>
    <p>      As explained in Chapter 1, Arthurian legends were often used in music, poetry and visual art in order to draw parallels with or project hopes and fears onto the modern world. Buckley’s Arthurian dramas were no exception, as he explained: ‘We do not seek to exhume the <em>body</em> of Arthur, but to bring the <em>soul</em> of him into modern life’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref40" href='#_ftn40'>[40]</a> ‘Modern parallelism’, writes Savage, ‘is central’ to <em>Arthur</em> <em>of Britain</em>. The modern world, Buckley felt, had descended into ‘chaos’, and it needed to be regenerated to become the ‘joyful garden’ it once was ‘long ago’. This regeneration would be achieved through a revival of the ‘Arthurian spirit’. This ‘spirit’ referred to a number of things, summed up by Savage as ‘investing a true leader with power’, ‘establishing an informed and ordered nationalised democracy’, ‘holding strenuously to an anti-materialist, anti-defeatist vision’, and ‘having faith that in a dark time the best of Britain’s ancient qualities will come alive again’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref41" href='#_ftn41'>[41]</a> <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> depicts the beginnings of this Arthurian spirit’s (re)emergence in the world, in the form of Arthur himself. Buckley’s libretto also introduces a metaphysical driving force behind this regeneration in the form of the ‘Will of the World’, a device that suggests the influence of Wagner’s favourite philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref42" href='#_ftn42'>[42]</a> Unlike Schopenhauer’s concept of the Will as a blind force of insatiable striving, however, <em>The Birth of Arthur</em>’s Will of the World appears to have a consciousness that causes particular events to unfold in the phenomenal world. It acts as a guiding force that directs Uther and Igraine’s love through the intermediary of Merlin.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref43" href='#_ftn43'>[43]</a> </p>
    <p>While Buckley’s poetic technique displays the influence of Wagner, for instance in the avoidance of conventional operatic numbers, his libretto also employed the original device of textual preludes and interludes which he referred to as a ‘verbal orchestra’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref44" href='#_ftn44'>[44]</a> These sections create atmosphere, describe characters’ emotional states and explain the deeper meanings behind the action.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref45" href='#_ftn45'>[45]</a> Savage observes that Buckley further translated Wagner’s musical methods into his literary style through a kind of literary leitmotivic technique.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref46" href='#_ftn46'>[46]</a> In <em>The</em> <em>Birth of Arthur</em>, for example, words and phrases found in the prelude to the first act, such as ‘Deep in the shadows’ and ‘wonder’, recur throughout the rest of the work, in both the dramatic dialogue and the verbal orchestra, and in some instances Boughton chose to attach his own musical leitmotifs to Buckley’s literary leitmotifs.</p>
    <p>A Wagnerian dimension of the libretto not highlighted by Savage is Buckley’s occasional adoption of an alliterative style in which two or three words in each line begin with the same consonant sound. It seems probable that this use of alliteration was, at least in part, inspired by Wagner’s <em>Stabreim</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref47" href='#_ftn47'>[47]</a> The technique is most apparent in some of the choruses, including the ‘Tintagel’ chorus at the beginning of Act II:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Dark and <em>st</em>ark and <em>st</em>rong</p>
      <p>Tintagel Castle <em>st</em>ands!</p>
      <p>The <em>s</em>plash and the <em>s</em>urge of the <em>s</em>ea on the rocks of Tintagel,</p>
      <p>The <em>b</em>oom of the <em>b</em>reakers,</p>
      <p>The echoes in <em>c</em>hasm and <em>c</em>ave ….</p>
      <p>O hear ye the <em>s</em>ong of the <em>s</em>urges […]</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>By providing Boughton with an ultra-Wagnerian libretto, Buckley made it possible for the composer to produce a musical setting that was also Wagnerian, through its use of leitmotifs, absence of set pieces and continuous musical flow. Moreover, many of the ideas that Buckley expressed in the libretto converged with Boughton’s own beliefs with regards to love, nationalism and race, and the importance of ‘religious’ ideas related to the ‘mystery’ beyond the ‘actuality of life’.</p>
    <h3>4.1.2 The Music</h3>
    <p class="first-para-section">Boughton’s admiration for Wagner did not prevent him from criticising the German composer for his approach to the ‘physical’ elements of music drama, for his obscure use of symbolism and for the lowly role afforded to the chorus in his works. Boughton claimed that Wagner had failed to develop either of the two principal functions of the chorus in Ancient Greek drama: ‘to create the right emotional atmosphere and to assist forward the story where the psychology of the crowd was needed in the development of the dramatic idea’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref48" href='#_ftn48'>[48]</a> In addition, Boughton stipulated that the chorus of his works would comment on and elucidate various aspects of the drama.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref49" href='#_ftn49'>[49]</a> His use of the chorus was also fundamental to the national dimension of his project because it was choral singing, he believed, that was ‘the chief glory of British music’ and ‘absolutely necessary to the English people’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref50" href='#_ftn50'>[50]</a></p>
    <p>The choruses in <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> are found in the extensive preludes at the start of each act, various short interludes and at a few other crucial moments in the drama. None of the choruses are sung by characters who form part of the action. Instead, they were all meant to be sung off-stage, though in practice, at Glastonbury, the dancers forming the scenery sometimes formed part of the chorus, and the limitations of space meant that the chorus would often be visible to the audience. With the exception of the ‘Voice of the Storm’ in Act I, all the choral passages are sung by the Will of the World, according to Buckley’s libretto. The choruses are mainly in four parts (soprano, contralto, tenor, bass), and there are a small number of passages marked for a ‘Chorus of Children’s Voices’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref51" href='#_ftn51'>[51]</a> </p>
    <p>      Most of the choruses in <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> are found in places where Wagner would have used only instrumental music. Indeed, Buckley’s text for the preludes originally formed part of his ‘verbal orchestra’, and was not intended to be set to music. But Boughton felt that Wagner’s ‘choral orchestra’ – a term he used to refer to Wagner’s use of the orchestra as a medium to comment on, narrate and elucidate the drama – was only able to suggest ‘subtle indications of character-mood which could not be expressed by words’. Boughton’s introduction of an ‘orchestral chorus’ to complement Wagner’s choral orchestra solved this problem by uniting the ‘sensuous orchestral appeal’ of music with ‘the appeal to the definite understanding of the intellect’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref52" href='#_ftn52'>[52]</a> In combining this with ‘dancing scenery’, Boughton found a way to satisfy each of the physical, intellectual and emotional appeals that he identified in music drama. Boughton’s aim seems to have been to communicate the same ‘religious’ ideas by as many means possible.</p>
    <p>      In a 1915 article Buckley wrote that one function of the chorus in its narrating role was its ability to relieve the main characters of having to sing at moments of extreme passion.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref53" href='#_ftn53'>[53]</a> Buckley suggested that this way of using the chorus would have the advantage of avoiding moments like those in Act II of <em>Tristan</em> when the lovers continue to sing throughout their erotic encounter. In the Act II love duet of <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> Boughton used the chorus in exactly the sort of situation Buckley described. After Uther sings ‘I would swoon within thine arms till time should cease!’, Boughton wrote the stage direction ‘They pass beyond the curtain’. Following this the orchestra returns to a theme associated with Igraine and love before the sudden entry of the chorus – the Will of the World – who sing: ‘Go, unruly torch, for Britain shalt thou burn, / And, in thy stead, shall come a light to Britain!’ (see Ex. 4.1). Choral interjections such as this, which appear in a number of other places in the score, had the dual purpose of making the dramatic action appear more natural by avoiding long explanatory monologues, while at the same time elucidating the significance of certain scenes – in this case the conception of Arthur.</p>
    <p>The function of the chorus in the preludes to each act is rather different. These choruses create the atmosphere for the action to follow, allude to the drama’s ‘religious’ ideas, introduce characters and leitmotifs, and, in the case of the prelude to Act II, evoke the location which will form the backdrop for the following scenes. The opening of the ‘Lake of Wonder’ prelude to Act I immediately plunges the audience into the mystical atmosphere that Boughton intended to create (the score of the entire prelude is given in Appendix II). In <em>Music-Drama of the Future</em>, Boughton provided a description of how he envisaged the opening scene: ‘The curtain will rise, with the first bar of the prelude, upon a scene of vagueness—a lake surrounded by high mountains, but the whole enveloped in opal mist, and nothing clearly seen’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref54" href='#_ftn54'>[54]</a></p>
    <p>      This opal mist is evoked by the opening music through a combination of harmonic, dynamic, timbral, temporal and registral characteristics. Namely, the <em>pianissimo</em> dynamic level; the ‘Very Slow’ tempo marking and the 8/8 time signature; the emphasis on the lower registers of both the strings and the chorus, with the sopranos omitted altogether to begin with; the muted and <em>divisi</em> solo strings; and the use of an augmented triad as the opening </p>

    <p>sonority. These first few bars also introduce, in the cellos in bars 2–3, one of two leitmotifs that permeates this prelude. This one is associated with the ‘Lake of Wonder’ and wonder more generally (the ‘Wonder’ motif). In this form the motif outlines the same augmented triad heard in the first bar: it begins on the pitch c, moves down to an E♮ on two occasions as the lowest point in the melody, and emphasises A♭ twice, by way of the note’s length.</p>
    <p>      A closer analysis of the first twenty-eight bars of the prelude reveals that this music is essentially a prolongation of the opening augmented triad built on C. During the first fourteen bars the bass, moving only between the notes C and its neighbouring tones of D and D♭, underpins a very limited harmonic vocabulary – including French and German sixth chords, and diminished chords – with all chords ultimately returning to the augmented triad on C. There is a sense, then, in which the augmented triad on C, and the note of C itself, becomes the tonic. To begin a music drama with an augmented triad and then to prolong it as if it were a conventional tonic was a bold gesture for a British composer to make before the First World War. Outside of Britain augmented triads were common in the music of composers such as Debussy and Scriabin, and they were part of a post-Wagnerian soundworld more generally. It seems unlikely, however, that Boughton’s use of the chord was inspired by Debussy, as he was highly critical of the French composer in his writings.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref55" href='#_ftn55'>[55]</a> It might well have been the case, then, that Boughton’s use of the chord was influenced by nineteenth-century examples in which the chord had extramusical associations with the magical and the other-worldly. Of particular importance are the examples of the chord found in the music of Wagner and Liszt. Schoenberg wrote in his <em>Harmonielehre</em>, that ‘the new German music did in fact favor the augmented triad’, and he pointed to the use of the triad in the ‘Ride of the Valkyries’ as the origin for many later experiments.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref56" href='#_ftn56'>[56]</a> The opening twenty-two bars of Liszt’s <em>Faust</em> Symphony are also made up almost exclusively of broken augmented triads, and, as a number of scholars have pointed out, the bass line in those bars effectively prolongs an augmented triad on A♭, just as the chromatic ascent in bars 14–28 of Boughton’s prelude begins on and returns to the augmented triad on C.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref57" href='#_ftn57'>[57]</a> </p>
    <p>      At bar 29 of Boughton’s choral prelude the music suddenly bursts into a diatonic, C major version of the ‘Wonder’ motif. Just as Wagner contrasted chromaticism and diatonicism for dramatic purposes, so too does Boughton contrast the gloomy mist of his chromatic and ‘augmented’ music with bright rays of diatonic sunlight. Even in the diatonic sections, however, Boughton, in Wagnerian fashion, usually maintains a sense of continuous musical flow through the avoidance of perfect authentic cadences. The ‘Wonder’ leitmotif dominates the musical texture during this C-major section, initially in its full form but then through various fragments of it. A new leitmotif introduced at bar 59 is associated with the character of Merlin (the ‘Merlin I’ motif; bb. 59–62), and the music following bar 74 introduces another motif associated with the wizard (‘Merlin II’ motif; see b. 76). This is heard in combination with the ‘Wonder’ motif in bars 78–81 as the chorus sing ‘To him are the Wonders of the Deep, / The Mysteries of the Earth […]’. Thus, both text and music link the magic of the Lake to the magic of Merlin. The chorus’s explanatory and elucidatory function here becomes apparent as it not only introduces the mysterious Merlin and his role as the ‘comrade’ of ‘destiny’, but, by explicitly associating Merlin with his musical motifs in the prelude, also allows the audience later to recognise the ‘old man’ in Act I as Merlin in disguise because he is identified by his leitmotifs. </p>
    <p>With regards to the music, the opening chorus demonstrates that while Boughton’s compositional style at this time was indebted to Wagnerian practices, it also diverged from Wagner in a number of ways. The Wagnerian aspects are to be found in the work’s use of leitmotifs and the Wagnerian nature of these leitmotifs; in the continuous musical flow and the avoidance, for the most part, of conventional cadences; and the avoidance, in the rest of the drama, of set-pieces. The use of the chorus is where Boughton’s music most clearly differs from Wagner’s, not only because it is used at all, but also due to the complexity of the choral writing, which brings it closer to the ‘world of oratorio’ than that of opera.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref58" href='#_ftn58'>[58]</a> Boughton’s harmonic vocabulary and in particular his use of an augmented triad as a ‘tonic’ in the ‘Lake of Wonder’ prelude also distinguish his music from Wagner. This aspect of Boughton’s music belong to a post-Wagnerian soundworld more than they do to a Wagnerian one. Although other parts of <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> are much more conventional in their approach to tonality (see the prelude to Act II, Appendix II), the opening chorus nonetheless highlights Boughton’s position at the vanguard of British musical Wagnerism at this time. It was not only in the realm of music, however, that Boughton reinvented aspects of Wagner’s <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em>, but also through his innovations in staging.</p>
    <h3>4.1.3 Staging, Dancing and Acting</h3>
    <p class="first-para-section">Although Wagner’s theories set out in <em>The Artwork of the Future</em> influenced Boughton in assigning a key role to dance in his choral dramas, in practice Boughton’s method of integrating dance into his dramas was very different from Wagner’s. In <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> and other productions that took place at the Glastonbury festival, movement and scenery merged into one through Boughton’s innovation of ‘dancing scenery’. Also referred to at the time as ‘human scenery’, ‘human staging’, ‘living scenery’ or ‘symbolised scenery’ this involved the dancers not only creating ‘the right scenic ideas in the minds of the audience’ but also symbolising ideas of greater emotional or ‘religious’ significance.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref59" href='#_ftn59'>[59]</a></p>
    <p>Like Wagner, Boughton disliked the gratuitous use of ‘Scenic and spectacular orgies’ associated with grand opera. However, Boughton argued that the use of staging and dance had a place in music drama insofar as they could ‘help to further the religious idea of the work’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref60" href='#_ftn60'>[60]</a> In an article written in 1915, Boughton writes that ‘Dancing was the first word of outer religious ceremonial as music was the first word of inner religious experience’, and the future for these ‘two most powerful and popular arts’ was to be found in their reunion ‘in a great religious purpose’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref61" href='#_ftn61'>[61]</a> Wagner, in Boughton’s view, had failed to unite music and dance in this way; he had neglected dance just as he had neglected the chorus. </p>
    <p>      While Boughton felt that Wagner’s ‘puritanical attitude to the ballet and the chorus’ had ‘deprived’ the <em>Ring</em> of a desired ‘communal touch’, he regarded <em>Parsifal</em> as a step in the right direction.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref62" href='#_ftn62'>[62]</a> Boughton referred to two examples: the dance and chorus of the Flowermaidens in the second act, which he described as ‘a properly developed example of stage chorus, half symbolic […], half dramatic’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref63" href='#_ftn63'>[63]</a> Second, he described the ‘the solemn Dance of the Knights of the Grail’, by which he seems to have meant the procession of the Grail Knights in the final act. This scene was significant, Boughton believed, because it meant that in <em>Parsifal</em>, not just the sinners, but the</p>
    <p>solemn ones dance as well. The scenery itself dances! This is the birth of a new soul in music-drama (or, rather, the re-birth of a very ancient soul),—the soul of Greek drama, wherein the personal issues of the characters are merged in the vast mystic issues of that choral dance which arose in the ritual of natural religion.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref64" href='#_ftn64'>[64]</a></p>
    <p>Yet, this procession does not constitute ‘dancing’ in a conventional sense; to understand it as such requires a broader conception of the term as referring to movement and gesture more generally. Boughton’s main motivation for concocting the rather contrived idea of <em>Parsifal</em>’s ‘solemn Dance’, was probably that it allowed him to position Wagner’s last music drama as the precursor to his own.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref65" href='#_ftn65'>[65]</a> Boughton’s use of the phrase ‘the scenery itself dances’, for instance, and his reference to ‘choral dance’ are clearly allusions to his own practices.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref66" href='#_ftn66'>[66]</a></p>
    <p>The kind of dance most prevalent in the operatic repertory of Wagner’s time – the ballet of Grand Opera – was associated with ‘everything Wagner despised: French artificiality, fashion, commercialism, loss of national identity’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref67" href='#_ftn67'>[67]</a> Consequently, in <em>Opera and Drama</em> (1851) Wagner developed instead the concept of ‘gesture’. Wagner contended that gesture – ‘the whole message of man’s outward semblance to the eye’ – communicates something that is ‘unspeakable’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref68" href='#_ftn68'>[68]</a> and just as this bodily gesture expresses the ineffable to the eye, so must music communicate the same inner meaning to the ear.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref69" href='#_ftn69'>[69]</a> Mary Ann Smart observes that, in addition to the ‘metaphysical’ conception of gesture as something that communicates the ‘unutterable’, there are ‘two other important guises that gesture takes on in the course of’ <em>Opera and Drama</em>: ‘the generative and the leitmotivically governed’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref70" href='#_ftn70'>[70]</a> In the first of these understandings of gesture, bodily movement does not emerge concurrently with musical gesture but rather ‘determines’ the rhythm and melodic shape of the music.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref71" href='#_ftn71'>[71]</a> By contrast, in the second view of gesture ‘the primacy of the gestural is subordinated to meanings articulated through reminiscence motives or leitmotives’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref72" href='#_ftn72'>[72]</a> Smart also refers to situations where ‘the motivic interdependence of gestural and leitmotivic […] suggests something more reciprocal’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref73" href='#_ftn73'>[73]</a></p>
    <p>Elements of Wagner’s ‘metaphysical’ and ‘reciprocal’ understandings of gesture are apparent in Boughton’s use of dancing scenery, but this practice was also shaped by the ideas and practice of three contemporary figures: the English theatre director and scenic designer Edward Gordon Craig (1872–1966), the American dancer Isadora Duncan (1877–1927) and the English dancer Margaret Morris (1891–1980). Boughton first became acquainted with Craig’s work at the start of the century,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref74" href='#_ftn74'>[74]</a> and later remarked that he became convinced that the director must be ‘one of the great artists of the world’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref75" href='#_ftn75'>[75]</a> In an article on ‘The Music of Gordon Craig’ the composer explained that he was familiar with Craig’s ideas regarding staging and other aspects of the theatre through reading Craig’s theatrical periodical <em>The Mask</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref76" href='#_ftn76'>[76]</a> Boughton believed that Craig was attempting to ‘place stagecraft in that condition of perfection which is suggested by the art of music’, and Craig himself, alluding to Walter Pater’s famous remark, wrote that his ideal theatre would ‘strive towards the condition of music’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref77" href='#_ftn77'>[77]</a> It would do this by eschewing ‘dramatic action in the usual sense’, instead utilising ‘a developing progression of emotional states’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref78" href='#_ftn78'>[78]</a></p>
    <p>      Craig’s ideas about staging, scenery and movement appear to have had an impact on Boughton’s work in a number of more specific ways. First, Boughton’s dislike of realistic staging, which he felt was suited only to comedy,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref79" href='#_ftn79'>[79]</a> and his preference for symbolism, reflected Craig’s writings on these subjects in <em>The Mask</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref80" href='#_ftn80'>[80]</a> Craig regarded symbolism in the theatre as ‘really quite proper; it is sane, orderly, and it is universally employed […] not only is Symbolism at the roots of all art, it is at the roots of all life’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref81" href='#_ftn81'>[81]</a> Following Craig, Boughton’s writings make it clear that he strongly favoured symbolic staging in both productions of his own works and in those of Wagner’s music dramas. In his remarks on the staging used at Bayreuth during his visit there in 1911, Boughton criticised Siegfried Wagner’s adherence to the ‘old-fashioned […] realistic methods [of staging] of the nineteenth century’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref82" href='#_ftn82'>[82]</a> This kind of staging, in Boughton’s view could not succeed in revealing the inner meaning of Wagner’s music dramas, which were ‘essentially symbolic’ in nature.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref83" href='#_ftn83'>[83]</a></p>
    <p>      The second way in which Craig might have influenced Boughton’s music dramas was with his belief in the ‘divine power of Movement’ to communicate passions, thoughts and emotions, and ‘reveal […] invisible things’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref84" href='#_ftn84'>[84]</a> Craig believed that the use of words to communicate emotions and spiritual ideas could be replaced by movement alone ‘which could act as direct revelation of the spiritual’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref85" href='#_ftn85'>[85]</a> In his book on <em>Parsifal</em> Boughton wrote that Craig’s methods had for the first time ‘introduced the right conditions’, in terms of staging, necessary to communicate the kind of ‘inner drama’ that characterises Wagner’s last drama.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref86" href='#_ftn86'>[86]</a> Craig’s use of movement thus achieved in a physical and visual form exactly what Boughton believed music did: it expressed religious ideas. That Boughton held a similar belief in the ability of movement to articulate emotional and spiritual meaning is demonstrated by his remarks on the opera productions of Marie Brema (better known as a singer) at the Savoy Theatre during 1910–11. He compared Brema’s work to Gordon Craig’s methods of staging and suggested that she had been the first to effect a truly ‘Wagnerian’ synthesis of music, colour and movement:</p>
    <p>She sees to it that each is the expression of a different side of the same thing. She is the first producer of music-drama in England who understands that the symbolism of gesture and colour (including scene, costumes and lighting) appeals to the same emotional capacity as does music.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref87" href='#_ftn87'>[87]</a></p>
    <p>Significantly, Wagner was also an important influence on a number of Craig’s writings: there are hints of Wagner in some of Craig’s early ideas regarding the architecture of theatres;&#8288;<a id="_ftnref88" href='#_ftn88'>[88]</a> the composer was a model for Craig’s ideal vision of the master artist in control of all aspects of his theatre;&#8288;<a id="_ftnref89" href='#_ftn89'>[89]</a> and the title of Craig’s 1907 essay ‘The Artists of the Theatre of the Future’ echoes Wagner’s <em>The Artwork of the Future</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref90" href='#_ftn90'>[90]</a> Ultimately, what Craig’s ideas offered to Boughton was an approach to staging and movement (or ‘action’) that was, in Boughton’s view, more Wagnerian in spirit than Wagner’s own productions were.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref91" href='#_ftn91'>[91]</a></p>
    <p>      An important influence on Craig’s ideas about movement was Isadora Duncan, an American dancer and at one time Craig’s lover. Duncan eschewed the movements of ballet and other conventional dance styles for a more improvisatory, ‘natural’ and simple technique, and she believed that she could translate the emotion and passion of music into movement and gesture.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref92" href='#_ftn92'>[92]</a> As Mary Simonson has detailed, Duncan was also a Wagnerite. Duncan made her Wagnerite credentials particularly clear in a 1903 speech she gave entitled ‘Der Tanz der Zukunft’ (‘The Dance of the Future’), in which Duncan alluded to many passages from Wagner’s <em>The Artwork of the Future</em>, and, like Wagner and Boughton, evoked the drama of ancient Greece to support her arguments.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref93" href='#_ftn93'>[93]</a> Duncan’s belief that all the arts were based in dance and movement and that movement could be used as a direct expression of emotions made a profound impact on Craig’s ideas about the role of movement in his ideal, ‘quasi-religious’ vision of a theatre founded on ‘action’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref94" href='#_ftn94'>[94]</a></p>
    <p>Duncan’s method of movement also made an impact on the performance style of Boughton’s dancing scenery when the idea was first put into practice at the Winter Gardens in Bournemouth in August 1913 (when the prelude and opening scene of the second act of <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> were produced for the first time). The choreographer of the dancing scenery on this occasion was Margaret Morris,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref95" href='#_ftn95'>[95]</a> a dancer who gave up more conventional methods after receiving dance lessons from Raymond Duncan, brother of Isadora, in Paris in 1909.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref96" href='#_ftn96'>[96]</a> Like his sister, Raymond Duncan took a strong interest in the dance of ancient Greece,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref97" href='#_ftn97'>[97]</a> and in a short lecture given in December 1913 and an interview in 1915, Morris explained that from Raymond she had learnt about a ‘Hellenic’ style of dancing, and that the ‘fundamental positions’ derived from this formed the ‘groundwork’ of all her movements.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref98" href='#_ftn98'>[98]</a></p>
    <p>      Morris later became well known for the various schools she founded to teach dance, along with all kinds of other artistic activities,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref99" href='#_ftn99'>[99]</a> but Boughton probably first became aware of her through her work as a choreographer and principal dancer in Marie Brema’s production of Gluck’s <em>Orpheus</em> in 1910.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref100" href='#_ftn100'>[100]</a> Morris acknowledged the influence of Isadora Duncan on her dancing, and was often compared with her in the press.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref101" href='#_ftn101'>[101]</a> This was because their performances looked very similar in a number of ways: they both danced in bare feet, loosely-fitted dresses, and frequently used the Dionysian, ‘maenadic’ gesture of a tilted-back head.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref102" href='#_ftn102'>[102]</a> Morris’s debt to Duncan’s methods is apparent in the photographs of her that were printed in the <em>Daily Graphic</em> the day after the Bournemouth performance in which Boughton’s </p>
    <p><img src="file:///C:\Users\Toshiba\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image012.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="img">Figure 4.1    Margaret Morris demonstrating the dancing scenery for the ‘Tintagel’ prelude to Act II of <em>The Birth of Arthur</em>, Bournemouth (1913), printed in ‘“The Birth of Arthur,” with Symbolised Scenery’, <em>Daily Graphic</em>, 29 Aug. 1913, 9.</p>
    
    <p>dancing scenery was tested for the first time (Fig. 4.1).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref103" href='#_ftn103'>[103]</a> The three images show Morris performing some of the movements from <em>The Birth of Arthur</em>. One can identify in these pictures a number of the features that Simonson lists as typical of Duncan’s style: ‘loosely wrapped in a flowing tunic secured by an elastic band that crisscrossed between her breasts and wound around her waist and hips’, ‘flat bare feet’, ‘chest and face frequently upturned toward the heavens’, ‘head often thrown back as if trailing behind’, ‘Her back flexible, arms often raised overhead or extended out to the side’, ‘the drape and flow of her tunic’s supple fabric’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref104" href='#_ftn104'>[104]</a> These photographs of Morris illustrated her movements for the dancing scenery accompanying the ‘Tintagel’ prelude to Act II of <em>The Birth of Arthur</em>. Of all the choral dances from <em>The Birth of Arthur</em>,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref105" href='#_ftn105'>[105]</a> the ‘Tintagel’ prelude serves as the best example for closer study because the vocal score manuscript of this prelude includes some pencilled-in indications of the dance movements and, in addition to the extant photographs of the choreography for this section, Boughton provided a detailed explanation of it in an article published in <em>The World’s Work</em> in November 1913, entitled ‘The Rights and Wrongs of Stage-Craft’.</p>
    <p>The <em>Daily News</em>’s report of the 1913 Bournemouth performance of the ‘Tintagel’ prelude described the appearance and actions of the dancers who created the dancing scenery:</p>
    <p>Enter four men, in stone-coloured jerkins and caps, from the back, and from the right and left some twenty dancing women in flowing garments of blue and green. The men form a square and sing how ‘Dark and stark and strong / Tintagel Castle stands’ while the women advance and retreat with tossing arms, telling in verse of ‘the splash and surge of the sea’ on the rocks of Tintagel.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref106" href='#_ftn106'>[106]</a></p>
    <p>When <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> was subsequently performed at the Glastonbury festivals, the dancing scenery appears to have been presented in largely the same form as described above. The <em>Western Daily Press</em>’s description of the formation of the Castle and the waves in the 1920 production, for example, is very similar to that described in the 1913 <em>Daily News</em> article: ‘the Tintagel Castle scene is suggested by a group of men set four square, with a set of dancers waving long bands of white chiffon to suggest the waves breaking on the rocks’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref107" href='#_ftn107'>[107]</a></p>
    <p>While the original idea for dancing scenery seems to have been Boughton’s own, Morris and to a lesser extent Christina Walshe (1888–1959) – whom Boughton met when she was an art student in Birmingham and who later became his unofficial second wife – played an important role in its execution. In his <em>World’s Work</em> article, Boughton notes that before the 1913 production it was Walshe who first sketched some designs to give the dancers a vague idea of what was envisaged. Two of these drawings are printed in the article: one was an introduction to a ‘death-scene’, which does not seem to be related to <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> (no one dies on stage), and the other depicts Tintagel Castle and the sea in the ‘Tintagel’ prelude (Fig. 4.2).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref108" href='#_ftn108'>[108]</a> Morris’s realisation of Walshe’s castle and sea sketch, along with various other dance movements for the prelude, were photographed outdoors (though not during the actual performance it would seem) and printed in Boughton’s <em>World’s Work</em> article.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref109" href='#_ftn109'>[109]</a> The picture captioned ‘Tintagel Castle Strongly Stands’ (Fig. 4.3) is clearly based on the Walshe design shown in Fig. 4.2 but uses far fewer people in the construction of the Castle and sea than suggested by the drawing. Indeed, Boughton noted in his article on ‘Stage-Craft’ that in Bournemouth, ‘as in many another place, we were hampered for lack of numbers’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref110" href='#_ftn110'>[110]</a> As demonstrated in Fig. 4.3, in the Bournemouth performance there are only four men standing in a square, wearing caps and jerkins to represent the castle, surrounded by about twelve women covered in sheets to represent the sea.</p>
    <p>      According to the direction written in the manuscript vocal score – ‘Castle forward’ – the Castle figure was first formed by the male dancers at the very opening of the prelude, </p>

    <p>accompanying the music that Boughton described as the ‘Castle theme’ – a broad, diatonic, arch-shaped theme in E minor played by the brass (see Appendix II for the score of the entire prelude). After bar 7 of the prelude, the female dancers are instructed to ‘drop as waves fall away’. Following the introductory bars the chorus enters and makes the association of the ‘Castle’ theme explicit, singing it to the words ‘Dark and stark and strong / Tintagel Castle stands!’. Shortly after this, at bar 17, a fourth statement of the ‘Castle’ motif is accompanied by the instruction ‘hands up to square’ for the male dancers (this can be seen in Fig. 4.4). The ‘Castle’ motif occurs two further times in the first part of this prelude (that is, up to b. 53), and each time it is accompanied by the same ‘hands up’ direction for the male dancers. The next instruction for the dancers pencilled in on the score occurs at bar 58. Here the texture and atmosphere of the music changes to prepare for the description of the mysterious Merlin brooding in his cavern beneath the Castle. The word ‘Cavern’ is written on the score at this point – over the exact bar in which the ‘Merlin I’ motif is first introduced in this act – and Boughton explains what was to happen: ‘a slightly realistic suggestion was obvious, when the four centre figures turned and made a hollow through which some of the dancers ran’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref111" href='#_ftn111'>[111]</a> The aftermath of this choreography can be seen in Fig. 4.5, in which the four men who previously formed the Castle have formed an archway, representing the entrance to the cavern.</p>
    <p>There appears to be a contradiction between Boughton’s professed disdain of ‘realistic’ staging and the attempt in the choreography of the ‘Tintagel’ prelude to represent real things: the castle, the sea, the cavern. However, just as Boughton defended the dragons, talking birds and flying horses of Wagner’s <em>Ring</em> as symbols of ‘emotional and intellectual ideas’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref112" href='#_ftn112'>[112]</a> so too did he argue that his human-formed sea and castle were not to be understood as mere representations of material things:</p>
    <p>any such attempt would defeat itself and result in absurdity. What was intended was to give the feeling of a recurrent fluidity of passion beating against an unwavering object; the actual ideas of sea and rock are described by the chorus and need no pictorial representation on the stage.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref113" href='#_ftn113'>[113]</a></p>

    <div class="image-container">
    <img src="/images/placeholder.png" alt="Placeholder">
    </div>

    <p>In any case, the next direction for the dancing scenery is less realistic. At the words, ‘While the Wisdom of the Ages / Slumbers in the womb’ (bb. 68–73), Boughton explained that ‘the chorus ceased all wave-movements, sank upon their knees, and made a frankly human appeal to the unknown Powers’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref114" href='#_ftn114'>[114]</a> This can be seen in Fig. 4.5, in which the men, still in the cavern position, are surrounded by women making a prayer-like gesture towards the heavens. Buckley’s words here seem to refer to the anticipation of the (re)birth of Arthur, who represents some mysterious higher power (‘the Wisdom of the Ages’) that will enable humanity to progress to a better state. The quasi-religious choreography, then, appears to be an attempt to symbolise this spiritual yearning. </p>
    <p>Similarly, another photograph of the dancing scenery printed in the <em>World’s Work</em>, taken from a chorus that occurs later in the second act rather than in the prelude (Fig. 4.6), depicts a vaguely religious gesture that was to accompany the words ‘O Wonder of Creation!’ sung by the Will of the World. In this case, while the male dancers continue to depict Tintagel Castle, the female dancers make star-like figures, some with their arms raised looking skywards and others at the front with their arms pointing outwards, invoking imagery associated with Christ and the crucifixion. As in some of the previous examples, this gestural motif is synchronized with a musical motif – the ‘Wonder’ motif. </p>
    <p>The remaining pencilled-in directions for the dancers in the score of the prelude to Act II relate to visualisations of the sea and castle. In order, these instructions appear as follows: ‘turn back to square’ at bar 76 with the return of the ‘Castle’ theme; ‘swirl up swaying feeling’ at bars 85–6 next to the words ‘Like to the sea in its strength / Is the passion of Uther!’; ‘dancers billowing movement’ at bars 98–9, which is shown in Fig. 4.4 and accompanies the text ‘Besieged by land and sky and sea, / By man and wave and wind beset’; </p>

    <img src="/images/placeholder.png" alt="Placeholder">
    </div>

    <p>and ‘recede slowly’ at bar 100. Finally, during the last statement of the ‘Castle’ theme in the orchestra and chorus (bb. 102–106), the score contains the instructions ‘always up and down, gradually dying away’, followed by ‘strongest here’ and ‘drop on one knee and rest’.</p>
    <p>Aside from his choral dances, Boughton was interested in the gesturing of operatic actors more generally. Boughton argued that in Wagnerian music drama ‘movement, gesture and change of picture must be generally slower and more dignified’, and the gestures of the actors must never be exaggerated or ‘in the slightest degree unnecessary’. Instead, they should be ‘as simple and direct as possible’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref115" href='#_ftn115'>[115]</a> Boughton admired some of the slow gestures and the near absence of movement he had witnessed at Bayreuth in 1911 because it was in these ways that he felt gesture could most effectively express, or symbolise, some ineffable idea. These kind of gestures complemented the symbolic nature of his vision of choral drama more generally. In his programme notes for the 1920 Glastonbury production of <em>The Birth of Arthur</em>, Boughton explained that his choral dramas were ‘by no means plays of action set to music, but the setting forth of ideas and characters, through the slow medium of music’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref116" href='#_ftn116'>[116]</a> By focussing on the ‘inner power’ of drama, as he put it, rather than the ‘mere externals’ of dramatic action,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref117" href='#_ftn117'>[117]</a> Boughton aligned his work with Wagner’s inward dramas of <em>Tristan</em> and <em>Parsifal</em> especially, and with German dramas more generally, which he had earlier characterised as ‘mystical and introspective’ and concerned with the ‘inner side of their characters’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref118" href='#_ftn118'>[118]</a></p>
    <p>      Through the use of dancing scenery Boughton found a way of expressing, through gesture, the inner drama that ‘takes place in the secret hearts of us all’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref119" href='#_ftn119'>[119]</a> as well as a form of stage-craft that was more symbolic than realistic, yet at the same time able to suggest physical settings. Boughton was also able to avoid the ‘unchanging atmosphere’ that he felt was a problem even in Gordon Craig’s theatrical productions, and was instead able to reflect the ‘fluctuating’, ‘mystical quality of music-drama’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref120" href='#_ftn120'>[120]</a> Moreover, this innovation enabled Boughton to unite music, words and gesture in a way that he believed had achieved a much more effective synthesis of these three primal sister arts than that found in Wagner’s music dramas. As the ‘Tintagel’ prelude demonstrates, Boughton synchronised particular musical leitmotifs with specific words and specific movements of his dancers. It was not Boughton’s intention, however, that one of these mediums should generate or govern the other as Wagner suggested in parts of <em>Opera and Drama</em>. Instead, the relationship he envisaged between these art forms was more akin to the reciprocal and metaphysical understandings of gesture considered by Wagner, in which all three mediums express the same religious ideas at the same time by their own means.</p>
    <p>The result of his reinvention of the <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em>, Boughton hoped, was not only a more genuine aesthetic synthesis of the arts, but a drama that could help Britain to emerge ‘out of an age of frost and materialism’ by communicating to its audience – through multiple mediums – inner, religious ideas that would lead to an ‘awakening of those spiritual energies which for so many years have remained uncared for’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref121" href='#_ftn121'>[121]</a> The regenerative socio-political dimension of Glastonbury and of works like <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> was, then, no less an important part of Boughton’s <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em>.</p>
    <h3>4.1.4 The People</h3>
    <p class="first-para-section">Creating a strong sense of community was a fundamental aim of the Glastonbury festival, and Boughton hoped to re-create the atmosphere of ‘good-fellowship’ that he felt he had experienced in Bayreuth in 1911.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref122" href='#_ftn122'>[122]</a> Judging from various accounts of the festivals, Boughton did just this. Percy Scholes observed in 1916 that after the performances one would find ‘the performers gathered as one merry party, laughing and joking together’. Amateurs and professionals drank side by side and the party included everyone from ‘Birmingham business men’ to ‘workers from the boot factory in the neighbouring village of Street’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref123" href='#_ftn123'>[123]</a> This communal spirit among the amateur and (semi-)professional performers was discernible, too, in the productions themselves according to some critics. <em>The Times</em> reported in 1920 that one of the greatest aspects of Glastonbury was ‘the way it brings together professional and amateur singers, and succeeds in co-ordinating their efforts, so that one thinks of them as contributing to the whole rather than as individuals’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref124" href='#_ftn124'>[124]</a></p>
    <p>Comments such as these must have pleased Boughton, for just as Wagner argued that the artwork of the future would be a ‘communal one’, which could ‘only arise from a communal yearning’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref125" href='#_ftn125'>[125]</a> so too did Boughton believe that ‘religious art’ ‘arises only in the communal spirit’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref126" href='#_ftn126'>[126]</a> In contrast with Bayreuth, however, the Glastonbury festival was never intended to be dedicated solely to the works of Boughton and Buckley but also to provide opportunities for performances of works by other artists. In this respect, then, Glastonbury came closer than Bayreuth to realising Wagner’s vision of a community of artists. Boughton’s festival was also arguably more successful than Wagner’s with regards to the involvement of ‘the people’. In the first article of a series published in <em>Musical Standard</em> in 1905–6 entitled ‘Music and the People’, Boughton argued that modern music was deficient because it was not bound up with the people. ‘<em>Only through the people is a great art made</em>’, wrote Boughton, and ‘the art of the future is theirs’ – that is, of the ‘working-people’, ‘the great masses of the people’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref127" href='#_ftn127'>[127]</a> Not only did Boughton encourage local working-class people to attend the performances at Glastonbury through offering cheap tickets,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref128" href='#_ftn128'>[128]</a> but he also succeeded in involving local people in the performances and other activities at the festival. In addition to enrolling in the classes of the festival school, which ran for a month before the performances began,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref129" href='#_ftn129'>[129]</a> local people also made up the majority of the choruses and dancers in productions of Boughton’s choral dramas, and were involved in various other aspects of production, including the creation of the scenery and costumes.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref130" href='#_ftn130'>[130]</a> In this way, then, there was a genuine sense in which ‘the people’ became the performers and creators of Boughton’s festivals.</p>
    <p>The festival school was also intended to educate and raise the moral standards of the local working classes by enriching their intellectual and emotional lives. Boughton wrote that it was a ‘school for the development of the sense of beauty and the joy of life’, and he wanted all members of the school to have access to ‘books, music, art and magazines not usually to be found in country places’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref131" href='#_ftn131'>[131]</a> This aspect of Boughton’s project was deemed to have been a great success by G. B. Shaw. In a letter to the <em>Western Daily Press</em> in August 1916, Shaw argued that Boughton should be exempt from military service because of the contribution he was making to the people of Glastonbury, who could now ‘hope to see their sons and daughters grow up as cultivated Englishmen and Englishwomen’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref132" href='#_ftn132'>[132]</a> When Shaw was asked by an interviewer in the same year whether the productions at the festival could really appeal to the ‘English population’, when music drama was ‘essentially an aristocratic form of art’, Shaw replied: ‘That is its precise justification. If democracy is going to be a success it must be a democracy of aristocrats’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref133" href='#_ftn133'>[133]</a></p>
    <p>      Shaw’s remark leads back to Boughton’s criticism of modern music’s failure to connect with the people, which was due to the ‘anti-democratic and obscure qualities’ that prevented the people from having any ‘hope of understanding it’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref134" href='#_ftn134'>[134]</a> But Boughton was not entirely clear as to whether he thought the solution to this problem lay in (a) composers intentionally transforming their musical language into one that could be more easily consumed by the people, (b) educating the people so that they could understand such ‘aristocratic’ art, as Shaw suggested, or (c) a combination of both. In one of his ‘Music and the People’ articles Boughton suggested that the reason why Brahms’s symphonies and Wagner’s music dramas were ‘stupid and meaningless to the great majority of the people’ was due to both ‘some unnatural tendency in the said symphonies and music-dramas’ and ‘some unnatural tendency in the lives’ of said people.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref135" href='#_ftn135'>[135]</a> Elsewhere Boughton identified one of the unnatural tendencies of Wagner’s art. It lay not in the music but in the drama, which often displayed a ‘very unfortunate strain of symbolism which muddied the clearness of his blood’; ‘Wagner had a great partiality for abstractions’ which obscured ‘definite religious idea[s]’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref136" href='#_ftn136'>[136]</a> </p>
    <p>      Similar criticisms could be, and have been, made of Boughton’s choral dramas. Buckley’s libretti were certainly inclined towards abstractions, and Boughton’s music, too, was considered to be complex and difficult to comprehend. A 1920 a review of <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> stated that ‘Mr Boughton is inclined to “modernism” in his work. He pours out a well-laden score full of developments and heavy chords, all on the “tone poem” system’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref137" href='#_ftn137'>[137]</a> More recently, George Revill has noted the futility of attempting to appeal to the masses with a musical language and politics that was entirely alien to most people: ‘One has only to listen to Boughton’s music to hear the hopelessness of this populist project based on elite cultural practices’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref138" href='#_ftn138'>[138]</a> Though Revill almost certainly wrote this without knowledge of the music of <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> specifically, his main point still stands: Boughton’s whole project was indeed tied up with practices that were completely alien to the people he wanted to connect with most, and if he wanted to make music that was easier for the people to comprehend, he failed on his own terms.</p>
    <p>      However, if Boughton’s intention was to educate the people so that they could understand and enjoy such ‘elite cultural practices’, rather than to alter his musical style to suit the people as they were, then Revill’s criticism is not entirely fair. In any case, as Hurd explains, Boughton’s musical style in his dramas composed after <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> became more straightforward and ‘folk-like’ ‘once the limitations of Glastonbury had made it obvious that a thoroughgoing Wagnerian approach was out of the question’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref139" href='#_ftn139'>[139]</a> It is ironic that it was only when Boughton distanced himself further from Wagner’s sound-world, symbolism and metaphysics that he was able to get closer to realising some of the utopian social dimensions of Wagner’s theories about the <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em>. If Boughton realised that the ‘democracy of aristocrats’ idea would only take him so far, then he must have recognised that for the artwork of his present to be truly for the people it would need to speak in a language that they, not just an intellectual elite, could easily understand. Ultimately, although the Glastonbury festival came to an end in 1927, and attempts to revive it elsewhere (in Stroud and Bath) were short-lived, the project constituted one of the most successful attempts anywhere in Europe to put into practice ‘the people’ dimension of the Wagner’s <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em> theories, while also combining this with the aesthetic ideals associated with the (re)union of the arts. </p>
    <h3>4.1.5 Nationalism and Race</h3>
    <p class="first-para-section">Educating the people in Glastonbury and the surrounding areas and enriching their lives through the arts and crafts of the festival was also part of a larger goal of regenerating country life and the nation as a whole. The countryside, Boughton suggested in his writings, not only represented the heart and soul of England but was also the place where people were most in contact with the ‘great mystic and creative forces in the world’. Revitalising the country, then, was essential if Britain was to ‘hold a great and noble place in the future’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref140" href='#_ftn140'>[140]</a> In his rejection of urban life and in seeking the path to Britain’s musical regeneration in the countryside, Boughton had much in common with other British composers of the time. Like some of these composers, Boughton took an interest in national folk music, but did not believe that a school of British music would be created ‘by “playing at folk-songs”—dressing them up as overtures, symphonies, and the like’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref141" href='#_ftn141'>[141]</a> Rather, it was the spirit of folk music – the music produced by ‘the people’ – that Boughton identified in the works of many of the past’s great composers. Thus, although folk song is not quoted directly in music such as Senta’s ballad from <em>Der fliegende Holländer</em>, the Shepherd’s song from <em>Tannhäuser</em>, and various parts of Elgar’s <em>Caractacus</em>, these pieces nonetheless captured ‘the outstanding force of folk music’, according to Boughton.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref142" href='#_ftn142'>[142]</a> Boughton’s interest in folk music was ultimately due to his nationalism, which in turn, he felt, was necessary as a step towards music achieving universality: ‘Any school of music must be national before it can be universal’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref143" href='#_ftn143'>[143]</a></p>
    <p>Before it had been decided that the festival would take place in Glastonbury, Boughton had originally favoured a location in the North of England. He agreed with Elgar that it was the North, rather than London, that constituted the ‘centre of musical England’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref144" href='#_ftn144'>[144]</a> and in the North music was a real part of the life of the masses, Boughton argued.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref145" href='#_ftn145'>[145]</a> In addition to Boughton’s interest in this real working-class North, he was attracted to the region because of what he believed were the racial characteristics of northerners: the North was the place where ‘the Celt and the Teuton have intermixed with the best results’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref146" href='#_ftn146'>[146]</a> Boughton discussed the racial characteristics of the English people in a number of his articles before and during the First World War, and from these writings emerge a number of key points. First, Boughton believed that the ‘blood’ of Englishmen and women was primarily comprised of German (Teutonic), French (Gallic and Norman) and Celtic elements.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref147" href='#_ftn147'>[147]</a> Second, the French or Gallic or Norman elements were to be suppressed.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref148" href='#_ftn148'>[148]</a> Third, the Teutonic element in the English people represented all the qualities that appealed to Boughton: strength, nobility and striving for what is lastingly just and true rather than what is immediately attractive’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref149" href='#_ftn149'>[149]</a> It was German blood, Boughton claimed, with which English people were ‘most nearly allied’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref150" href='#_ftn150'>[150]</a> Finally, the Celtic element contributed a number of other characteristics to the national character:</p>
    <p>it has been our luck to get the Teutonic strain crossed with the Keltic, and while that cross has tended to make us careless and lazy in work, it has afforded some compensation by refining our habits, increasing the dignity and beauty of our women, causing us to regard hate as a comical thing, and to some extent clarifying our abstract ideas by a continual reference to reality.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref151" href='#_ftn151'>[151]</a></p>
    <p>In highlighting the strong connections between the English and the Germans, Boughton was implicitly attempting to justify his emulation of Wagner in his own music dramas. Because of their shared Teutonic blood, Wagner was regarded as an appropriate source of inspiration for English artists. The Celtic themes of works like <em>Tristan</em> further encouraged the idea that Wagner’s works were somehow British (see the next chapter on this point, too).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref152" href='#_ftn152'>[152]</a> During the First World War, both Boughton and Buckley felt it necessary to play down their earlier emphasis on the importance of the Anglo-German relationship, and this also meant being more cautious with regards to the impact of Wagner’s influence. In Boughton’s case, he continued to hold Wagner in high regard during the War, arguing that he had ‘revealed to the Germans all that is most worth their while’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref153" href='#_ftn153'>[153]</a> But he also now recognised that Wagner’s influence could have bad, not just good, consequences: </p>
    <p>Wagner then has given us the most perfect expression of German character, and in so doing has increased the power of that character for good and evil in whatsoever proportions he has chosen.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref154" href='#_ftn154'>[154]</a></p>
    <p>Boughton still believed that Germany offered a model for creating and encouraging national art (through state support), but this model was now to be emulated not in a spirit of admiration, as had been the case before the war, but rather in a spirit of competition. The German Government’s support of national music, Boughton argued, had helped increase the German people’s ‘sense of moral strength’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref155" href='#_ftn155'>[155]</a> and this, in turn, had made the German people more prepared for war. By contrast, Boughton wrote that the British character ‘has had little national expression in any form, and until quite lately none in music and drama since the days of Elizabeth’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref156" href='#_ftn156'>[156]</a> Not only did this lead to ‘inferior aesthetic sensibilities’ among the British people, Boughton contends, but it had ‘material’ consequences as well: it is ‘dangerous to our national welfare’, he wrote, particularly during wartime.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref157" href='#_ftn157'>[157]</a></p>
    <p>      In order to continue to emphasise their kinship with Wagner but to minimise the importance of his Germanness during the war, Boughton and Buckley both referred to the concept of an Aryan race. Savage explains that Buckley was impressed by Houston Stewart Chamberlain’s <em>The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century</em>, particularly with its advocacy of Aryanism and Teutonism.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref158" href='#_ftn158'>[158]</a> Although Boughton dismissed Chamberlain’s claim that ‘the German race has got to rule the world by divine right because everything of worth has had a German origin’ as ridiculous, he suggested that Chamberlain was ‘using the German idea where most of us would refer to the white race’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref159" href='#_ftn159'>[159]</a> Boughton does not expand on this topic in his other writings, but it demonstrates that he believed in a sort of ‘race-kinship’, as Buckley put it, between the Teutonic people and the people of Britain, if not among white Europeans more generally.</p>
    <p>      Boughton’s interest in the Celtic element of British national identity was further indicated by the geographical location of his festivals. Boughton explained that Glastonbury was a suitable location for the performance of his dramas, not only because the Arthurian legends ‘had evolved around that district’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref160" href='#_ftn160'>[160]</a> but also because the area was ‘peculiarly suitable to the mystical atmosphere which pervades all good music and drama’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref161" href='#_ftn161'>[161]</a> In addition to its Arthurian associations, Glastonbury’s ‘mystical atmosphere’ was perhaps engendered by its proximity to the Celtic world. Though not actually situated on a border, the site is close enough to both Wales and Cornwall to be understood as a liminal location where England comes into contact with the Celtic world. Boughton had earlier written that the best path for English music was to follow a Teutonic influence ‘wrapped in a Celtic mist’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref162" href='#_ftn162'>[162]</a> He might, then, have seen Glastonbury as a place where the German-blooded English become enveloped in a Celtic haze that drifted over from Cornwall in the south-west and from over the Bristol Channel and the River Severn in the north and north-west. Moreover, like many Wagnerian projects that had links to the Celtic world – the setting of <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> is also Celtic Cornwall – Boughton’s Glastonbury project intersected with themes of national regeneration. In a 1911 article, written after his visit to Bayreuth, Boughton wrote that opera, in German culture, was ‘a real act of religious worship’ in which ‘the private desires of the individual are continually expressed for the public good’. If such circumstances could be recreated in Britain, a ‘great national music-drama could regenerate the British people’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref163" href='#_ftn163'>[163]</a> </p>
    <p>      Ideas about race, nation and regeneration were not only relevant to the broader aims of the Glastonbury festival, but also to Boughton and Buckley’s Arthurian dramas themselves, at least in the case of <em>The Birth of Arthur</em>. These ideas are most apparent in the way in which the prophet- and Wotan-like Merlin brings Uther and Igraine together so that they will produce the hero, Arthur, who will regenerate a future Britain. At the end of the drama the Will of the World chorus makes Arthur’s regenerative significance explicit: ‘Britain lies in darkness’, we are told, but the ‘soul of the Hero alone shall save you, […] / And bring you to the Dawn!’. Savage explains that Buckley wanted to depict Merlin as someone who acts ‘for the good of the race’. Consequently, the libretto is ‘in line with the kind of “positive eugenics” <em>à la</em> Francis Galton so fashionable in some circles in the 1900s and 1910s’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref164" href='#_ftn164'>[164]</a> Savage notes that Merlin’s ‘family-planning’ is also concerned with the progress of evolution and achieving regeneration through the synthesis – in the form of Arthur – of the opposing forces symbolised by Uther and Igraine:</p>
    <p>Arthur’s engendering by a passionate, powerful, driven Uther on a beautiful, thoughtful, nurturing Igraine can be seen as the model for the regeneration of modern society: something which can only be brought about through the union of Britain’s brute imperial power with the nurturing, beautifying ideals of the turn of the century’s aesthetic movements, the Arts and Crafts Movement especially.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref165" href='#_ftn165'>[165]</a> </p>
    <p>This reading of Buckley’s libretto is convincing but it could equally be read, from Boughton’s perspective, as a coming together of Teutonic/English, masculine characteristics in the form of Uther, and Celtic, feminine elements in the form of Igraine (it is noteworthy that while Uther is the King of all of Britain, Igraine is the Queen of Celtic Cornwall). Boughton’s various later works inspired by Celtic themes – notably <em>The Immortal Hour</em> and his Second Symphony, ‘Deidre’ – indicate that he associated the Celtic world with the beautiful, enchanted, ‘feminine’ elements, which he felt modern Britain was lacking, and were required for its regeneration. Elsewhere he was explicit about the gendering of the Teutonic and the Celtic, writing that ‘a masculine expression preponderates in the Teutonic, and a feminine expression in the Celtic nature’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref166" href='#_ftn166'>[166]</a> What emerges from the metaphorical (literal in <em>The Birth of Arthur</em>) sexual union of the Teutonic and Celtic spirits is a new kind of Britishness, symbolised by Arthur.</p>
    <h2>4.2 Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">Boughton and Buckley’s nationalism was cloaked in a language of racial characteristics and eugenics that had some disturbing implications, even if the pair had good intentions. For Boughton, however, nationalism was really just one method by which he hoped to (re)discover or reveal to the people a certain spirit. This universal spirit had been expressed in Wagner’s music dramas, Boughton felt, but it needed to be expressed to the British people in a language they understood: Arthurian legends. Ultimately, for Boughton at least, nationalism was only a means to a far greater end, an end which may be summed up by what Buckley (and Boughton would no doubt have agreed) gave as the definition of Wagnerism: ‘a vision of a better earthly life’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref167" href='#_ftn167'>[167]</a></p>
    <p>Driven by such a vision of a better earthly life – no doubt a socialist or communist one – Boughton pursued a Wagnerian agenda persistently and explicitly like no other British composer during the first two decades of the twentieth century. Rather than simply imitating Wagner, Boughton took on the challenge of reinventing every aspect of the Meister’s <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em> for twentieth-century Britain. The fusion of the arts of music, poetry and dance was not just an artistic experiment for Boughton, but crucial for enabling the communication of his ‘religious’ ideas to the people, which in turn would help to bring about the regeneration of national culture and even racial identity. In combining Buckley’s ultra-Wagnerian libretto, his post-Wagnerian musical language, innovative use of the chorus and approach to dance with the wider socio-political aims of Glastonbury, Boughton’s project constitutes the single most ambitious manifestation of British Wagnerism. Moreover, Boughton was unique among British musical Wagnerites in providing such an extensive output of theoretical writings to underpin his Wagnerian practices – a fact that further highlights his faithfulness to Wagner’s own methods. In terms of the scale of his Wagnerian ambitions, only one other British composer approached Boughton, and that was Joseph Holbrooke.</p>

      <p><a id="_ftn17" href='#_ftnref17'>[17]</a> The first part of the work to be heard was the prelude to Act II which was given as a symphonic poem, ‘Tintagel’, without a chorus, at concerts in Leeds and Bournemouth in November and December 1908. Four years later, in March 1912, there was a performance in Birmingham of the final scene from <em>Uther and Igraine</em>, as it was still then called, and the same year witnessed a performance in Bournemouth of a section from Act II named ‘Merlin’s Prophecy’. In October four episodes from the work were given as ‘dramatic song’ at a concert in Crispin Hall in Street, Somerset where Boughton himself sang the part of Merlin. In 1914 there was another performance of an orchestral arrangement of part of the work: the final ‘choral dance’ from Act II, under the title ‘Love and Night’ (given at the Proms on 20 October).</p>

      <p><a id="_ftn20" href='#_ftnref20'>[20]</a> Boughton orchestrated almost the entirety of Act I (forty-six bars at the end of the act are all that is missing), and there exist orchestral concert versions of the three excerpts from Act II that were performed between 1908 and 1914: the ‘Tintagel’ prelude, ‘Love and Night’ and ‘Merlin’s Prophecy’. The latter includes Merlin’s vocal part but the other two arrangements omit the choral parts that are present in the music drama.</p>

Boughton and the Rutland Boughton Music Trust for granting me permission to photograph these manuscripts for study purposes.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn22" href='#_ftnref22'>[22]</a> Boughton argued in an 1898 article that music, being ‘the language of the soul, the heart, [and] the unutterable feelings’, is the greatest of all the arts. Poetry, ‘the expression of the intellect’, comes next in his rankings, followed by sculpture and, lastly, painting – ‘at best a despicable art’.

Boughton perhaps had in mind the following passage of Wagner’s essay when he wrote this: ‘Without the heart the activity of the brain would remain mere mechanical trickery; equally the activity of the outer limbs would remain mechanical, empty gesture. Through the heart the mind feels linked to the whole body, the merely sensory human is elevated to a fully intelligent human’. Wagner, ‘The Artwork of the Future’, trans.

A contemporary critic, Herbert Antcliffe also observed this technique, writing that the librettist had ‘employed a system of frequently recurring phrases which he regards (though the system is not as highly or as subtly developed as it should be to justify the term) as literary <em>leit-motive</em>, and of course this is not without its effect on the music, which in its main principles is Wagnerian’.

The 1925 production at Glastonbury was choreographed by Penelope Spencer (1901–93) who worked with Boughton on various projects over a number of years. The 1915 performances of choral dances from Act II of the drama were directed by Kathleen Dillon and Flossie Jolley. Spencer, Dillon and Jolley were all students of Morris, and it seems as though their choreography, and Wilson’s, too, largely followed Morris’s original ideas.

      <p><a id="_ftn105" href='#_ftnref105'>[105]</a> Reviewing the 1925 productions of <em>The Birth of Arthur</em>, the critic for the <em>Western Daily Press</em> noted that there were ‘four principal dance numbers’: the choral preludes to each act – ‘The Lake of Wonder’ (Act I) and ‘the Castle of Tintagel and the Sea (Act II) – in addition to the choruses of the ‘Magic Storm’ scene (Act I) and ‘Love and Night’ (at the end of Act II). ‘Glastonbury Festival’, <em>Western Daily Press</em>, 28 Aug. 1925, 9.</p>

Hurd, <em>Rutland Boughton and the Glastonbury Festivals</em>, 83. In 2017’s money this is equivalent to about £15 and £7.50 respectively. Bayreuth could have served as inspiration Both Boughton and Buckley, after their 1911 visit to Bavaria, were keen to highlight that there was a special fund provided by the organisers to contribute to the ticket, travel and living expenses of poorer students. Boughton, ‘The Bayreuth Festival, 1911. IV.—General Considerations’, 22.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn129" href='#_ftnref129'>[129]</a> The idea for the school might have been inspired by Wagner’s unrealised plans for a music school in Munich to train the singers who took part in his productions. Buckley was certainly aware of this, noting in 1911 that Hans Richter had announced his intention of ‘carrying out Wagner’s plan for a school of music-drama’. Buckley, ‘The Theatre at Bayreuth’, 22. Attendance at the Glastonbury school was also reasonably inexpensive: a whole week’s accommodation and board cost between £1 and £1. 10s, according to Hurd – between £60 and £90 today).</p>
