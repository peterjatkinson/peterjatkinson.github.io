    <h1>CHAPTER 1</h1>
    <h1>Parry’s <em>Guenever</em></h1>
    <p class="first-para-section dropcap">Having ventured into the world of Wagnerism at the start of the decade with his cantata <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> (1880), and having been closely involved with the activities of the London Wagner Society in the 1870s, it must have seemed that if any British composer was going to compose an opera in the 1880s that would be thoroughly Wagnerian it was Hubert Parry. Ironically, it would turn out to be Parry’s attempt to do just this that ultimately drove him away from Wagnerism. After the failure of his operatic experiment, <em>Guenever</em> (completed in short score in 1886 but never orchestrated),<a id="_ftnref1" href='#_ftn1'>[1]</a> Parry continued to praise Wagner in his writings, positioning Wagner’s music as the apotheosis of a long tradition of Western music.<a id="_ftnref2" href='#_ftn2'>[2]</a> But Parry came to regard opera post-Wagner as something of a musical dead end, writing in 1893 that ‘the number of new operas [since Wagner’s death] which have any genuine pervading vitality may be counted on the fingers of one hand’.<a id="_ftnref3" href='#_ftn3'>[3]</a> Wagner, having devised ‘the most elaborately organised system for the purposes of dramatic musical expression that the world has ever yet seen’,<a id="_ftnref4" href='#_ftn4'>[4]</a> was unsurpassable. Parry retreated from the realm of music drama altogether and focussed his energies during the rest of his career on musical genres which were not overshadowed by Wagner.</p>
    <p>Because <em>Guenever</em> was not orchestrated and never performed or published, it has received only limited scholarly attention: Jeremy Dibble has detailed the circumstances surrounding the opera’s conception, compositional process and its assimilation of Wagnerian musical procedures; Michael Allis has examined the sketches for <em>Guenever</em> and suggested, like Dibble, that the project was significantly hampered by its libretto, put together by Una Ashworth Taylor (1857–1922).<a id="_ftnref5" href='#_ftn5'>[5]</a> This chapter will provide a new perspective on <em>Guenever</em> by situating it not only in the context of British and European Wagnerism but also in relation to nineteenth-century British Arthurian art, especially that of the Pre-Raphaelites. In particular, this chapter will focus on two aspects of <em>Guenever</em>, which, while stemming from the Arthurian sources that inspired the opera, can also be considered as two strands of Wagnerism. First, there is the tale of Lancelot and Guenever’s doomed illicit love and their betrayal of King Arthur – analogous with the Tristan-Isolde-King Marke love triangle of Wagner’s <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>. Closely linked to this strand are the broader Wagnerian themes of guilt, repentance and redemption, and, as we shall see, some of the Arthurian art of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. These aspects of the work demonstrate that far from being an incoherent and inconsistent opera with a libretto by an inexperienced young woman, <em>Guenever</em> is an intentionally complex and ambiguous opera that draws, in part, on an alternative Arthurian tradition from that of Tennyson in order to achieve a dramatic effect that is Wagnerian in its psychological depth and its emotional insight into its characters. The second Wagnerian strand is concerned with the broader theme of the collapse and (promise of) renewal of an ideal society, linked to Arthur’s death (or ‘passing’) and the promise of his rebirth or that of the ideal he represents. This side of <em>Guenever</em> situates the opera in the wider context of British and European <em>fin-de-siècle</em> Wagnerism that was consistently concerned with themes of regeneration.</p>
    
    <h2>1.1 Dannreuther and Parry’s Wagnerian Apprenticeship</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">Parry’s place in the history of British Wagnerism was determined to a large extent by his relationship with Edward Dannreuther (1844–1905), one of the most important proponents of Wagner’s music in nineteenth-century Britain. Beginning in the late 1860s Dannreuther promoted Wagner’s music and that of the New German School through a number of organisations and ventures, most notably the Working Men’s Society, the Wagner Society and the series of concerts and events held at his home in Orme Square in London.<a id="_ftnref6" href='#_ftn6'>[6]</a> Parry took a ‘lively interest’ in the concerts of the London Wagner Society that Dannreuther helped to organise in the early 1870s,<a id="_ftnref7" href='#_ftn7'>[7]</a> and Dannreuther soon became Parry’s piano teacher and an influential musical mentor, under whose guidance Parry became engrossed in Wagner’s music. This led to him attending two performances of <em>Lohengrin</em> in 1875, productions of <em>Tannhäuser</em> and <em>Der Fliegende Holländer</em> in 1876 (all in London), and a visit to Bayreuth in August of the same year to witness the premiere of the <em>Ring</em>.<a id="_ftnref8" href='#_ftn8'>[8]</a> Already in 1875, Parry had been converted to Wagner’s conception of opera, writing after seeing <em>Lohengrin</em> that ‘Wagner is right in his idea of what an opera should be. Nothing can be more ridiculous than stereotyping human nature as it must be portrayed on the stage into a system of arias, recitatives, trios, etc. in fixed plan’.<a id="_ftnref9" href='#_ftn9'>[9]</a></p>
    <p>If Parry was impressed by <em>Lohengrin</em> in 1875, his experience of the <em>Ring</em> cycle in the following year pushed his Wagner enthusiasm to new heights: ‘I give up all attempts to describe my own feelings. I never was so perfectly satisfied in my life’.<a id="_ftnref10" href='#_ftn10'>[10]</a> In the wake of this Wagner fever came the visit of the Meister himself to London in 1877. Wagner’s trip to London and the concurrent series of Wagner concerts organised to raise money for Bayreuth were instigated and arranged primarily by Dannreuther. In addition to meeting Wagner, Parry was able to attend many of the concerts and rehearsals, including one on 16 May which included ‘Siegfrieds Tod’, a section from <em>Götterdämmerung</em> that Parry described as ‘the greatest thing in the world’.<a id="_ftnref11" href='#_ftn11'>[11]</a> Parry was also present at Dannreuther’s home the following evening when Wagner recited his recently completed text for <em>Parsifal</em>, and though his lack of fluency in German meant that his understanding of it was rather hazy, Wagner’s presentation made a great impression on him.<a id="_ftnref12" href='#_ftn12'>[12]</a> After Wagner’s visit Parry continued to attend what were by that time numerous performances of Wagner’s music in London, and in 1882 he went to Bayreuth again to see the premiere of <em>Parsifal</em>, writing afterwards that as ‘a work of art it is at the very highest point of mastery’.<a id="_ftnref13" href='#_ftn13'>[13]</a></p>
    <p>      Just over a decade after Parry began his Wagnerian apprenticeship with Dannreuther, he began work on what would be his only attempt at composing an opera: <em>Guenever</em>. The project was fraught with difficulties, partly because of Parry’s health problems, but largely due to the fact that Parry did not get on with his young female librettist, Una Taylor. Dannreuther, who supported and advised Parry throughout his work on <em>Guenever</em>, did not approve of Taylor’s libretto and ‘thought it inevitable to rewrite a good deal of it’.<a id="_ftnref14" href='#_ftn14'>[14]</a> Taylor herself recalled that under Dannreuther’s ‘supervision every page was re-written’.<a id="_ftnref15" href='#_ftn15'>[15]</a> As Taylor’s copy of the libretto is no longer extant, and the surviving libretto remains only in the form of the short score, it is difficult to know the extent to which Taylor’s original words were altered by Parry and Dannreuther. Their revisions could well have been extensive, however, as Michael Allis’s study of some of the sketches for the opera has shown that they are in some cases substantially different from the later short score.<a id="_ftnref16" href='#_ftn16'>[16]</a> The surviving libretto may be regarded, then, as the result of a combined effort by Taylor, Parry and Dannreuther.</p>
    <p>      Despite reservations about the libretto, Parry was confident enough, with Dannreuther and Stanford’s support, to have the opera taken by Stanford to Carl Rosa in order to secure a production of <em>Guenever</em> in London. After Rosa rejected it, the libretto was translated by Parry’s German tutor, Friedrich Althaus, and taken to opera houses on the Continent during the summer of 1886, including in Mannheim and Munich.<a id="_ftnref17" href='#_ftn17'>[17]</a> There was no more success in Germany than there had been at home, so Parry soon gave up on <em>Guenever</em> altogether; no part of it was ever performed in his lifetime and at present only short excerpts of it have been orchestrated and recorded. One apparent reason for the rejection of the opera in Germany was <em>Guenever</em>’s Arthurian scenario, which was deemed too similar to Karl Goldmark’s Arthurian opera, <em>Merlin</em>, which was to be premiered in Vienna in November 1886. In fact, Parry’s and Goldmark’s operas were just two of many European Arthurian operas created around the same time, all of which were to some extent Wagnerian, in part due to the influence of Wagner’s own Arthurian operas: <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>, <em>Parsifal</em> and <em>Lohengrin</em>.<a id="_ftnref18" href='#_ftn18'>[18]</a> Though not the first British composer to draw on Arthurian legends, Parry was the first to combine these with Wagnerian musical techniques.<a id="_ftnref19" href='#_ftn19'>[19]</a></p>
    <p>      Nineteenth- and twentieth-century British musical Arthurianism was usually influenced by one or more of the following: Thomas Malory’s <em>Le Morte Darthur</em> (1485), a collection of eight Arthurian tales in Middle English, largely based on pre-existing French and English sources;<a id="_ftnref20" href='#_ftn20'>[20]</a> Alfred Tennyson’s <em>Idylls of the King</em>,<a id="_ftnref21" href='#_ftn21'>[21]</a> twelve poems (and an epilogue) based on, but also diverging from, Malory’s <em>Morte</em>; and, finally, the Arthurian-themed paintings, drawings and literature produced by the Pre-Raphaelites and associated artists, which were themselves often inspired by Tennyson or Malory. The Arthurian scenario of Parry and Taylor’s opera (see the plot summary in Appendix I) drew on all three of these sources: in particular, they drew on the final story of Malory’s <em>Morte</em>, ‘The Dethe of Arthur’; the final two poems of Tennyson’s <em>Idylls</em>, ‘Guinevere’ and ‘The Passing of Arthur’; and aspects of Arthurian paintings and literature of Edward Burne-Jones (1833–98) and William Morris (1834–96). Thus, although <em>Guenever</em>’s scenario was chosen in part because of its convergence with Wagnerian themes, it must also be viewed in the context of a tradition of British Arthurian art that was independent of, though shared a number of characteristics with, Wagnerism.</p>
    <p>      By the time Parry came to compose <em>Guenever</em> he was already very familiar with Tennyson’s <em>Idylls of the King</em>, which he had known ‘since his early days at Oxford’.<a id="_ftnref22" href='#_ftn22'>[22]</a> Parry’s early readings of the <em>Idylls</em> even led to him composing an orchestral overture named <em>Vivien</em>, completed in 1873 but no longer extant. Parry did not read Malory’s <em>Le Morte Darthur</em>, however, until Una Taylor convinced him that it would be preferable to base their opera on Malory’s rather than Tennyson’s version of the legends. This would result in making ‘Gareth’s death, not Guenevere’s faithlessness, the main motive in the tragedy’.<a id="_ftnref23" href='#_ftn23'>[23]</a> The decision to base fundamental aspects of <em>Guenever</em>’s scenario on <em>Le Morte</em> rather than Tennyson’s <em>Idylls</em> is significant because it aligns the work with a strand of Arthurianism, found especially in the work of the Pre-Raphaelites, that was more morally ambiguous than Tennyson’s moralising texts. Parry and Taylor mixed in circles in which Pre-Raphaelite artists were prominent, so it is likely that they knew some of this group’s Arthurian-themed paintings and poetry. In Parry’s case, after initially expressing a dislike for the paintings of Edward Burne-Jones, he came to know both Burne-Jones and William Morris personally in the early 1880s and began to warm to their art. In fact, it was 1883, the year before he began work on <em>Guenever</em>, that marked the beginning of Parry’s ‘cordial relations’ with these artists. From this point on Parry regularly attended dinners where they were present and later became a good friend of Burne-Jones in particular – the Pre-Raphaelite artist most associated with Arthurian imagery.<a id="_ftnref24" href='#_ftn24'>[24]</a></p>

    <h2>1.2 Musical Wagnerism in <em>Guenever</em></h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">Jeremy Dibble suggests that Parry attempted, inconsistently, to incorporate into <em>Guenever</em> a number of Wagnerian musical techniques. In addition to trying to emulate ‘Wagner’s seamless canvas’, Dibble writes that these methods included</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>a manner of vocal declamation informed by prose and irregular periodicity, the symphonic dimension of the orchestra, the psychological dimension of the libretto […] and leitmotivs (which form the cement for the larger passages of declamation as well as the raw material for musical <em>and</em> dramatic development).<a id="_ftnref25" href='#_ftn25'>[25]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In <em>Guenever</em>, leitmotifs are associated almost exclusively with people, in particular with the characters of Arthur, Gareth, Guenever, Lancelot and Mordred (see Ex. 1.9 for Arthur and Mordred; Ex. 1.7 for Gareth; and Ex. 1.4 for Guenever and Lancelot).<a id="_ftnref26" href='#_ftn26'>[26]</a> Of these five leitmotifs, it is only the ‘Guenever’ and ‘Lancelot’ motifs that are built into the musical texture throughout the whole work. Parry employs these motifs not only when these characters are physically present or explicitly referred to, but also occasionally to indicate a character’s implicit influence on events or, in one instance at least, to reveal a contradiction between the text and the true emotions of a character. In the case of the ‘Arthur’ motif, it becomes detached from the physical person of Arthur at the end of the work and comes to signify instead the ideal that he represents. Parry’s use of leitmotifs, then, was not merely a superficial method of musical labelling but demonstrated a sophisticated absorption and understanding of the technique found in Wagner’s music dramas.</p>
    <p>      In a dictionary entry he wrote on leitmotifs Parry also noted the possibility that characters or ideas could be associated with distinct rhythms, harmonic progressions or ‘instrumental tone[s]’,<a id="_ftnref27" href='#_ftn27'>[27]</a> and his opera also illustrates the use of ‘associative tonality’ (the use of certain keys in association with particular ideas, objects or people).<a id="_ftnref28" href='#_ftn28'>[28]</a> This technique, employed frequently by Wagner and Wagnerian composers, is not used extensively in <em>Guenever</em> but Eb major is used to link three significant points in the opera that are related to King Arthur and, more importantly, the ideal he embodies. Parry’s use of another Wagnerian technique mentioned by Dibble – ‘vocal declamation informed by prose and irregular periodicity’ – is far less convincing,<a id="_ftnref29" href='#_ftn29'>[29]</a> and some of the choruses in particular resort to formulaic patterns and structures. The more predictable and unimaginative aspects of the music were in part a result of Taylor’s libretto which contains many sections employing strict rhyme schemes. These parts of the libretto would, in more conventional forms of opera, be set by the composer as detached ‘numbers’. Taylor’s words for the opening chorus are typical of her more formulaic writing, which was matched by Parry’s strophic music in which each verse ends predictably with a perfect authentic cadence in G major (the second verse is given below): </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>      Sweet love in Winter sleeps,</p>
        <p>      But in May to light he leaps!</p>
        <p>      Winter’s gloom doth chill him,</p>
        <p>      But Spring’s delights now fill him.</p>
        <p>      Lovers call again to mind,</p>
        <p>      Gentle deeds and service kind.</p>
        <p>      Love’s birthday comes in May,</p>
        <p>      Crown him all true lovers!<a id="_ftnref30" href='#_ftn30'>[30]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This chorus and the others like it in the opera (the one that opens the second act, for example; see Ex. 1.3 below) are not especially Wagnerian either musically or textually, but these parts of the work are counterbalanced by less rigidly structured music and text elsewhere. As with other British opera composers of the time, then, Parry struck a balance between modern Wagnerian music drama and more traditional operatic conventions.<a id="_ftnref31" href='#_ftn31'>[31]</a></p>
    <p>Compared to other British 1880s operas by Mackenzie and Stanford (see the Introduction), there is in general a much a greater sense of continuous flow in <em>Guenever</em>, not just within scenes but also between them. This is in spite of the fact that the opera comprises a number of tonally closed set pieces, ending with an authentic cadence in the key in which they began. But even in these cases, the cadences are more often than not elided and followed by transitional passages rather than pauses or breaks as sometimes found in Stanford and Mackenzie’s operas. Moreover, in various places Parry opts for the more Wagnerian method of evading an expected resolution altogether: at the end of ‘Arthur’s Dream’ from Act II, for example (Ex. 1.1), a conventional chord progression of II-V<sup>6/4</sup>-V<sup>7</sup> fails to reach the expected tonic A major chord, instead culminating with a sudden shift to a flattened submediant chord and then a transition to a Bb major/G minor tonal region. At other points, Parry follows Wagner’s method of prolonging dominant pedals for a substantial period of time before ultimately avoiding the resolution. This is the case in the scene of Guenever’s death near the end of the opera (Ex. 1.6, below) where a dominant pedal on D is effectively prolonged for nineteen bars, but when Guenever dies some time later the music comes to rest on a first inversion Eb major chord. </p>

    <p>      Another aspect of the music of <em>Guenever</em> that indicates the influence of Wagner is the way in which the music often modulates suddenly to keys a third or a semitone away. These modulations are often effected through common tones and the equivalence of dominant-seventh and German augmented-sixth chords, techniques which, although found in much nineteenth-century music, were used more extensively in Wagner’s music dramas than anywhere else. Richard Taruskin writes that </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In Wagner’s ripest style, any dominant seventh can resolve as an augmented sixth (and vice versa) […]. Any tone can act as a common tone to create instant—if illusory, temporary—links between chords that are remotely placed along the circle of fifths, the traditional arbiter of harmonic relatedness.<a id="_ftnref32" href='#_ftn32'>[32]</a></p>
    </blockquote>     
    <p>An example of a sudden common-tone modulation to the flat submediant is found in Guenever’s Soliloquy (Act I), which, Dibble writes, ‘demonstrates a coherent ABA macro-structure and well-defined tonal scheme (F – D flat – F)’. At the join between the first A and B sections a root position F major chord simply turns into a first inversion Db major chord, and the music carries on in the new key (Ex. 1.4).<a id="_ftnref33" href='#_ftn33'>[33]</a> Parry’s exploitation of the equivalence of the augmented-sixth and dominant-seventh chords is demonstrated by the music that precedes the last act’s love duet, a tonally closed section in D major. In order to modulate from Eb to D major, a semitone downwards, the Ab of a prolonged V<sup>7</sup> is respelt as a G#, allowing the chord to then resolve as an augmented sixth to a I<sup>6/4</sup> chord in D major which is then followed by V-I progression in the new key (Ex. 1.2). The music before the start of the duet proper also subtly alludes to the music of <em>Tristan</em> through the gentle chromatic movements in the bass and inner parts underneath the fragments of the ‘Guenever’ motif in bars 1–2 and 5–6 of Ex. 1.2, and there is a half-diminished-seventh (Tristan) chord in bar 6.</p>
    <p>While <em>Guenever</em> might not sound especially Wagnerian to us today, in the context of 1880s British music it was the most Wagnerian British opera of its time in terms of musical style. But it is the combination of Parry’s partial assimilation of Wagnerian musical procedures with the Wagnerian dimensions of the libretto, to which this chapter will now turn, which determines <em>Guenever</em>’s significance in the history of British musical Wagnerism.</p>

    <h2>1.3 The <em>Tristan</em> Strand: Illicit Love, Guilt, Repentance and Redemption</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">In order to understand <em>Guenever</em>’s highly ambiguous approach to its themes of illicit love, guilt, repentance and redemption, and where all these stand in relation to contemporary Wagnerian currents, it is first necessary to take a closer look at the opera’s librettist, Una Taylor. Beginning in the 1880s Taylor wrote poetry, nine books (including novels, collections of stories and a study of Maurice Maeterlinck) and was involved in embroidery and other arts and crafts.<a id="_ftnref34" href='#_ftn34'>[34]</a> She also came to know a number of significant artists and prominent figures, including Burne-Jones and his son, Philip, George Frederick Watts, Robert Louis Stevenson, William Morris, Cornelia Sorabji and William Gladstone.<a id="_ftnref35" href='#_ftn35'>[35]</a> Jeremy Dibble explains that Taylor was suggested as a librettist by Sir George Grove who ‘believed that her enthusiasm for opera, and more particularly Wagnerian music-drama, would be appropriate to Parry’s own operatic conceptions’.<a id="_ftnref36" href='#_ftn36'>[36]</a> Following the accounts of their collaboration left by Parry, later commentators on <em>Guenever</em> – Dibble and Allis – have been highly critical of her contribution to the opera, suggesting that Taylor’s inexperience led to a libretto which is ‘uninspiring’ ‘inadequate’ and ‘inconsistent’.<a id="_ftnref37" href='#_ftn37'>[37]</a> While it is true that Taylor was not an experienced writer at this point, her work on <em>Guenever</em> should still be taken seriously. </p>
    <p>Taylor’s first two novels, <em>Wayfarers</em> (1886) and <em>The City of Sarras</em> (1887),<a id="_ftnref38" href='#_ftn38'>[38]</a> share a number of characteristics with her libretto for <em>Guenever</em>, and contemporary and more recent assessments of her novels suggest that her literary abilities were not without merit, contrary to the judgements of her libretto for <em>Guenever</em>.<a id="_ftnref39" href='#_ftn39'>[39]</a> As well as employing a similar kind of ‘archaic language’ to that found in <em>Guenever</em>,<a id="_ftnref40" href='#_ftn40'>[40]</a> <em>The City of Sarras</em> is partly based on Arthurian legends, and both novels, Talia Schaffer observes, tell of how ‘a woman’s tragic desire for the wrong man causes her to fall ill and gradually decline’.<a id="_ftnref41" href='#_ftn41'>[41]</a> The libretto for <em>Guenever</em> follows the same narrative: Guenever is in love with Lancelot (the ‘wrong’ man), and this love leads to her defamation and ultimately her death. Schaffer concludes that <em>The City of Sarras</em> ‘has all the hallmarks of an aesthetic text’ and was a significant accomplishment for an inexperienced woman novelist in 1887.<a id="_ftnref42" href='#_ftn42'>[42]</a> The aestheticism Schaffer identifies in Taylor’s literary works aligns it more broadly with a <em>fin-de-siècle</em> current that was closely linked with symbolism, decadence and Wagnerism, and which in Britain frequently drew inspiration from the Pre-Raphaelite movement.<a id="_ftnref43" href='#_ftn43'>[43]</a> Taylor’s libretto for <em>Guenever</em> should be considered in this context. The archaic language shared by <em>Guenever</em> and <em>The City of Sarras</em>, for instance, resembles that of the Pre-Raphaelites, and <em>Guenever</em>’s focus on its female protagonist, along with its themes of illicit love, sin, guilt and redemption clearly demonstrate the opera’s alignment with the spirit of various <em>fin-de-siècle</em> artistic movements, such as decadence, whose proponents were often admirers of Wagner.<a id="_ftnref44" href='#_ftn44'>[44]</a> </p>
    <p>While <em>Guenever</em> does not indulge in decadence, it does have its moments of subtle and restrained fleshliness and eroticism, and the ending has parallels with the conclusion of <em>Tristan</em>.<a id="_ftnref45" href='#_ftn45'>[45]</a> Perhaps the most significant indication of <em>Guenever</em>’s alignment with this kind of <em>fin-de-siècle</em> Wagnerism is found in the moral ambiguity surrounding Lancelot and Guenever’s apparent repentance (or lack thereof) for their betrayal of Arthur. Ellis Hanson observes that many of Wagner’s ‘heroes are at once pious and perverse, great converts and great sinners, who languish in the shadow of temptation and hysteria no less fervently than in the beatific rays of redemption’.<a id="_ftnref46" href='#_ftn46'>[46]</a> Such a description could equally apply to Guenever, whose pleas for redemption are counterbalanced by her frequent admissions of her love for Lancelot and her submission to temptation in the final act. </p>
    <p>The opera’s focus on a corrupted, sexualised woman also reveals its affinity with a number of <em>fin-de-siècle</em> representations of women as <em>femme fatales</em> or those found in the works of ‘men such as the Pre-Raphaelites, Swinburne, Wilde, and Beardsley [which] depict women as little more than objects of desire or symbols of sexual aberrancy and decay’.<a id="_ftnref47" href='#_ftn47'>[47]</a> Hanson observes that these depictions of women again find precedents in Wagner:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Wagner is preoccupied with feminine evil, the Eternal Woman who ceases somehow to be a cliché in his rendering, and his various femmes fatales, his Kundrys and Venuses, resonate well with the literary and pictorial Salomés of the age.<a id="_ftnref48" href='#_ftn48'>[48]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Taking into account the aestheticist and even proto-decadent leanings of Taylor’s writings that are contemporaneous with or came after <em>Guenever</em>, along with the wider cultural and aesthetic milieu that these works belong to, allows for an interpretation of the opera that views its apparent contradictions as entirely consistent with a particular current of <em>fin-de-siècle</em> art that was closely tied to Wagnerism.</p>
    <p>As noted above, the most obvious dramatic parallel between <em>Guenever</em> and Wagner’s music dramas, is the love triangle of Lancelot-Guenever-Arthur in Parry’s opera and that of Tristan-Isolde-Marke in <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>. Taylor’s libretto even makes this parallel explicit by having the chorus of ladies at the opening of Act II sing about the other trio of Arthurian characters (see Ex. 1.3).<a id="_ftnref49" href='#_ftn49'>[49]</a> While this chorus constitutes the only explicit textual reference in <em>Guenever</em> to <em>Tristan</em> or any of Wagner’s other Arthurian characters, the influence of <em>Tristan</em> also looms large in the final act. Moreover, by focussing on Lancelot and Guenever’s forbidden love, <em>Guenever</em> intersects with a number of broader Wagnerian themes, not limited to <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>, but present in practically all of Wagner’s operas. These include love versus law, the desire for and glorification of death, and sin, guilt, forgiveness, repentance and redemption. These topics were also pertinent to Victorian ideas about morality, and so by bringing them into the framework of an English opera Parry and Taylor had to navigate a potentially tricky path. On the one hand they risked championing adulterous love and venturing into realms of taboo sensuality or even decadence; on the other hand, the opera might simply have reaffirmed conventional Victorian values by unreservedly condemning Guenever and Lancelot’s love and emphasising their repentance for their sins.<a id="_ftnref50" href='#_ftn50'>[50]</a> The fact that <em>Guenever</em> ultimately follows something of a middle path – neither fully glorifying nor denouncing Guenever and Lancelot’s love – is typical of an opera that in various ways attempts to temper Wagnerian impulses within an English context.</p>

    <p>Before examining the final act of <em>Guenever</em> it is necessary to consider a crucial scene in the opera’s first act in which Guenever, led to the stake for her imminent execution, protests her innocence. Not only does this scene reveal the Pre-Raphaelite, Morrisian influence on the opera, but it also sets up the characterisation of Guenever as a strong, defiant, sensual and yet morally weak and ambiguous woman (I follow Dibble in referring to this section as Guenever’s Soliloquy (Act I); Ex. 1.4).<a id="_ftnref51" href='#_ftn51'>[51]</a> The scene of Guenever at the stake, her rescue by Lancelot and Lancelot’s unintended murder of Gareth are all events described in Malory’s <em>Le Morte Darthur</em>.<a id="_ftnref52" href='#_ftn52'>[52]</a> What is not in <em>Le Morte Darthur</em> is the impassioned speech that Guenever makes in Taylor and Parry’s opera as she is being led to the stake. However, a similar scenario is found in the title poem of William Morris’s 1858 volume <em>The Defence of Guenevere and Other Poems</em> – ‘the first published volume of Pre-Raphaelite verse’<a id="_ftnref53" href='#_ftn53'>[53]</a> – in which Guenevere, about to be burned at the stake, makes an impassioned plea for her release.<a id="_ftnref54" href='#_ftn54'>[54]</a></p>
    <p>      Parry and Taylor would almost certainly have known Morris’s poem, not least because they both knew Morris personally and, to a certain degree, admired his work. Moreover, various textual parallels between Guenever’s Soliloquy and Morris’s poem suggest that the latter was Taylor’s source. Guenever(e)’s opening remarks in both texts express a sense of hopelessness regarding what she can say in her defence. Morris’s Guenevere exclaims ‘“O knights and lords, it seems but little skill / To talk of well-known things past now and dead. / God wot I ought to say […]”’. Similarly, the soliloquy of Taylor and Parry’s Guenever begins ‘Alas! God knows but little can I say; / Yet hear me’. Both Guenever(e)s attempt to elicit sympathy from the ‘knights’ and ‘lords’ present by asking them to look upon their tear-soaked faces: ‘“Being such a lady could I weep these tears / If this were true?”’ (Morris); ‘What more, O knights, is there now need to say? / Look on my face all scarred with tears!’ (Taylor/Parry). </p>

    <p>The description of Guenever(e)’s tears emphasises her sensuality in both works, though in Morris’s poem she is more explicitly presented as a sensual Pre-Raphaelite woman through the narrator’s description of her long ‘wet hair’. Parry, on the other hand, emphasises her sensuality through his impassioned music. During the course of the Soliloquy, Guenever employs almost the full soprano range to depict a wide range of emotions, from fear and sadness to anger and defiance. The Soliloquy also has a wide dynamic range complementing a number of climactic outbursts (notably at ‘Blameless, unstained / And unashamed and glad’ and at the final words ‘I have ne’er betrayed my Lord, King Arthur’) and more quiet but tense and urgent moments (at ‘Look on my face all scarred with tears!’). Parry thus effectively depicts Guenever’s emotional instability and provides us with a sonic sense of her sensuality.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the most significant similarity between Morris’s poem and Taylor’s libretto, however, is the ambiguity surrounding the extent of Guenever(e)’s guilt. In each work Guenever(e) protests her innocence and accuses her accusers of lying about her guilt: ‘Ye answer not, because ye know we loved not so!’ (Taylor/Parry); ‘“God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie”’ (Morris). In both speeches, however, Guenever also admits to loving Lancelot in some form or another, thus casting doubt on her fidelity to the King.<a id="_ftnref55" href='#_ftn55'>[55]</a> In Parry and Taylor’s <em>Guenever</em>, it is unclear whether Guenever and Lancelot have consummated their love. Immediately after Guenever exclaims ‘ye know we loved not so!’, Guenever appears to contradict herself, singing ‘I loved him; yea my lords, I will not lie!’. Guenever then reaffirms her innocence once more at the end of her soliloquy: ‘Witness we loved not so, / That I have ne’er betrayed my Lord, King Arthur’. Guenever’s protestations of innocence are belied, however, by the music which accompanies them. The ‘Lancelot’ motif is prominent in the orchestra throughout the soliloquy and, most significantly, at the end, where it elides with the words ‘I have ne’er betrayed my Lord, King Arthur’, suggesting that behind her claims of loyalty to the King lurk all the while her true feelings of love for Lancelot (see Ex. 1.4). The contradiction between the music and text at this point also demonstrates Parry’s at least partial adoption of Wagner’s technique of using leitmotifs in the orchestra to comment on and add further meaning to the drama.</p>
    <p>      By having Guenever submit to Lancelot’s advances at the nunnery in the final act of the opera, Parry and Taylor present a radical subversion of the narratives of the legend provided in Malory and Tennyson. In Tennyson’s version of the story (‘Guinevere’), Guinevere retreats to a nunnery at Almesbury (Amesbury), repents for her sins and is forgiven by King Arthur (‘as Eternal God Forgives’). In Malory’s <em>Le Morte</em>, Gwenyver similarly becomes a nun and later the abbess at Amesbury, but rather than Arthur it is Launcelot who comes to visit her and pleads with Gwenyver ‘madame, I pray you kiss me’. This scene is the inspiration for Lancelot’s seduction of Guenever in Act IV of Parry’s opera, but unlike in <em>Guenever</em>, Malory’s Launcelot follows Gwenyver’s example by living out the rest of his life as a holy man. There is, then, a clear moral framework in Tennyson and Malory in which Guinevere’s repentance is unequivocal. </p>
    <p>This framework is shattered by the scenario of Taylor and Parry’s opera, which ultimately fails to provide any definitive moral judgement on the pair’s adulterous love. The commentary from the chorus during and just after Guenever’s death casts confusion on the morality of Guenever’s actions one final time: ‘Full well she loved. / Has she then fallen beyond recall? / Has she thus sinned beyond remission? / Sure God will pardon her! / She sinned not so basely! / Full well she loved’.<a id="_ftnref56" href='#_ftn56'>[56]</a> After Guenever’s death, the nuns pray for God to accept her soul into heaven and that Arthur will forgive her and meet her in Paradise: ‘May the saints who in Paradise / Enjoy eternal rest, / Receive thy weary spirit / To peace among the blest. […] May royal Arthur greet thee, / Nor for thy sins disown […]’. This again seems to suggest that Guenever should be forgiven, even after her failure to atone for her sins. The opera ultimately appears to be sympathetic towards the sinner, and in being so it takes a Wagnerian and, more generally, a <em>fin-de-siècle</em> stance on morality. </p>
    <p>Michael Allis criticises Taylor’s libretto, arguing that although the work’s subject matter ‘might suggest a thoughtful presentation of a subject particularly pertinent to the Victorians, the problem of morality surrounding Guenever herself’, in the end ‘Taylor’s libretto is inconsistent’.<a id="_ftnref57" href='#_ftn57'>[57]</a> Another reading of the opera would argue that the ambiguities surrounding morality in the opera, along with the sympathy that seems to be expressed towards the lovers, are typical of Pre-Raphaelite representations of Guenever and Lancelot in poetry and visual art. In this tradition of Arthurian art the emphasis is on the characters’ human weakness, fallibility, inner turmoil and personal passions and desires rather than clear moral didacticism. In the case of Morris’s poem, for instance, Laura and Robert Lambdin write that although the text ‘does not underscore the principles of conventional morality so favored by Tennyson’, it ‘allows an audience to be less judgmental and more understanding of Guenevere’s moral confusion’.<a id="_ftnref58" href='#_ftn58'>[58]</a> Christine Poulson similarly notes that paintings and drawings by Dante Gabriel Rossetti depicting Guenevere and Launcelot, such as <em>Arthur’s Tomb</em> (1855) and <em>Sir Launcelot in the Queen’s Chamber</em> (1857), ‘seem to work against any suggestion of judgement or condemnation of the lovers’. The latter painting (Fig. 1.1), she suggests, ‘invites the spectator to empathise with Launcelot and Guenevere’ rather than the knights who have just discovered them and are trying to break into the room (a scene very similar to that of the final one of <em>Guenever</em>).<a id="_ftnref59" href='#_ftn59'>[59]</a> As demonstrated in particular by Guenever’s Soliloquy in Act I, Parry and Taylor’s opera exhibits a strong interest in the psychological aspects of its characters, exploring their inward emotions. This, too, accords with the Pre-Raphaelite Arthurian tradition,<a id="_ftnref60" href='#_ftn60'>[60]</a> and is also one of the qualities of Wagner’s music dramas that Dibble suggests <em>Guenever</em> attempted to emulate.<a id="_ftnref61" href='#_ftn61'>[61]</a></p>
    <p>While one reason for Taylor and Parry’s deviation from Malory and Tennyson at the end of the opera was to avoid an anti-climax, the original ending they created for <em>Guenever</em> also made possible some significant dramatic parallels with <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>. Guenever and Lancelot’s love duet, for example, which is interrupted by the vengeful Lyones,<a id="_ftnref62" href='#_ftn62'>[62]</a> and then followed by the fatal stabbing of Guenever, recalls Act II of <em>Tristan</em>.<a id="_ftnref63" href='#_ftn63'>[63]</a> Moreover, the fact that the conclusion of Parry’s opera (notwithstanding the nuns’ final chorus) focusses on the last words of its female protagonist and her death, invites comparisons with Isolde’s <em>Liebestod</em>. The way in which Guenever welcomes death as a redemption from earthly suffering in particular suggests the influence of <em>Tristan</em>, while reminiscences of the night worship from Act II, scene ii of Wagner’s music drama are found in the night imagery evoked by Guenever: ‘O death, art thou near? / Thy kindly shade is welcome. / Thou bringest peace and stillness / To weary heart’s relief. / Receive me to thy bosom, / And hide me as in night’.</p>
    <p>There are also significant differences between <em>Tristan</em> and <em>Guenever</em>. Most notably, by presenting Guenever as a conflicted woman who constantly flits between expressing her love for Lancelot and her immense feelings of guilt for her betrayal of the King, Taylor and Parry problematise the adulterous love to a degree that is not found in <em>Tristan</em>. The fact that this love has to be problematised at all is perhaps a sign of some lingering anxieties in the minds of the opera’s creators over how the work would be received in Britain. There is a sense that Parry and Taylor attempted to ‘Anglicise’ <em>Tristan</em>, a work which in many ways was antithetical to Victorian morality. Another difference between <em>Guenever</em> and <em>Tristan</em> is the fact that Guenever’s death lacks the metaphysical dimension of Isolde’s <em>Liebestod</em>. There is no sense that Guenever is about to enter some mystical union with Lancelot,<a id="_ftnref64" href='#_ftn64'>[64]</a> whose ultimate fate is not made clear in the extant score.<a id="_ftnref65" href='#_ftn65'>[65]</a> In fact, the final chorus suggests that it is Arthur rather than Lancelot whom Guenever will meet in heaven – an idea completely antithetical to the spirit of <em>Tristan</em>. One might even argue that Guenever’s redemption is a redemption <em>from</em> love rather than a redemption <em>through</em> love.</p>
    <p>      It is also worth considering the extent to which Parry’s music is Wagnerian in these two sections that are dramatically analogous with parts of <em>Tristan</em>: the love duet and Guenever’s death (Exx. 1.5 and 1.6). Unsurprisingly, Parry’s music is harmonically far more conservative than Wagner’s. As noted above, there are some interesting chromatic inflections in the music that precedes the love duet (Ex. 1.2), including a ‘Tristan’ chord, but these chromaticisms are subsumed in a more conventional diatonic framework. In the duet itself the harmonic vocabulary is fairly unexceptional, comprised largely of triads, seventh chords and elaborations thereof. There are some prominent half-diminished chords but these effectively function as secondary dominants (or at least as predominant chords) within a short, predictable sequential passage. The duet as a whole is tonally closed in D major, and this, in addition to the relative B minor, is the only prominent tonality throughout. The conclusive perfect authentic cadence in D major at the end of the duet contrasts with the much-anticipated but dramatically evaded resolution at the end of Tristan and Isolde’s duet in Act II, scene ii of <em>Tristan</em>, and the sense that the duet is a ‘number’ set off from its surroundings is further accentuated by the absence of either the ‘Guenever’ or ‘Lancelot’ motif throughout. Only after the perfect authentic cadence does the ‘Lancelot’ motif make a brief appearance, functioning as part of a transitional instrumental passage.</p>
    <p>Parry does, however, maintain a degree of Wagnerian continuity within the duet itself through the avoidance of authentic cadences prior to the final definitive one. But this continuity is somewhat undermined by the partially strophic structure at the start of the duet, suggested by Taylor’s text: Lancelot three times begins ‘Canst thou forget’ and concludes ‘Was Lancelot then nought to thee?’. Each of these repeated phrases are accompanied by broadly similar musical gestures each time they occur, although Parry has clearly tried to avoid the more rigid strophic structures of some of his other choruses. Even after these strophic elements are abandoned, and the time signature changes from 3/4 to 3/2, there remains a fairly consistent two-bar periodicity.</p>

    <p>The music in the scene of Guenever’s death is arguably more effective and more Wagnerian than the earlier duet, and it achieves a sense of urgency and drama to match the situation. In addition to the use of a prolonged dominant pedal (bb. 10–28 of Ex. 1.6), which is never properly resolved, the agitated chromaticism preceding Guenever’s entrance and the (implied) orchestration also suggest the influence of Wagner. The tremolo strings that accompany Guenever were no doubt inspired by the similar effect at the start of Wagner’s <em>Liebestod</em> – one that creates a sort of sonic mist to establish death’s association with a sense of drowning and dissolution. Parry is also more successful in this section in embedding a sense of motivic continuity into the musical texture, with a version of the ‘Guenever’ motif present before she sings ‘Seek thou the ways of God’ and in the bars immediately after her death (bb. 44–7 and 55–8 of Ex. 1.6). As with the love duet, however, there are also major differences with Wagner’s music and with the <em>Liebestod</em>: most notably the phrase structures are again formulaic, with a series of two- and four-bar patterns dominating between bars 9 and 29 of Ex. 1.6; and in contrast to Isolde’s transfiguration, Guenever dies with a <em>pianissimo</em> whisper, rather than in a blaze of glory. </p>
    <p>      The focus on Guenever’s death at the end of the opera, highlights the fact that <em>Guenever</em> belongs to a particular group of post-Wagnerian operas that have been described by Barbara Eichner as ‘redemption operas’.<a id="_ftnref66" href='#_ftn66'>[66]</a> These Wagner-influenced redemption operas highlight and often glorify the deaths of their protagonist(s), in addition to frequently exhibiting a ‘striking transcendental dimension that had not been as conspicuous earlier in the nineteenth century’.<a id="_ftnref67" href='#_ftn67'>[67]</a> The ‘transcendental dimension’ of <em>Guenever</em> is perhaps not as notable as that of 1890s British Wagnerian operas by Bantock and MacCunn, in which there are great flashes of light and images of souls rising to heaven. Nonetheless, the fact that Guenever’s death is extended in a <em>Tristan</em>-esque fashion and commented on both during and after by a chorus that reflects on and prays for the redemption of her soul in heaven clearly aligns <em>Guenever</em> with this group of <em>fin-de-siècle</em> Wagnerian operas.</p>

    <p>The crucial difference with <em>Tristan</em> is that Guenever’s death and solo passage is the penultimate rather than final event of the opera. Parry and Taylor opt instead for a chorus followed by twenty-four bars of orchestral music to bring the work to a close. But this is also typical of Wagnerian and post-Wagnerian operas composed in the 1880s and 90s. Eichner explains that </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>hardly any of the post-Wagnerian mythological operas ends with a monologue of the heroine (or hero) […]. Instead, the chorus is reinstated in a central function and has the final say. It could be argued that composers of the younger generation took their inspiration from <em>Tannhäuser</em> or <em>Parsifal</em> for their finales, where both the role of the chorus announcing the successful redemption and the Christian content are conspicuous.<a id="_ftnref68" href='#_ftn68'>[68]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>With regards to Eichner’s last point about ‘Christian content’, she further explains that, unlike the Meister himself, ‘most of his successors […] imbued their finales not just with Christian imagery but also with Christian beliefs’.<a id="_ftnref69" href='#_ftn69'>[69]</a> Parry himself was no Christian by the mid-1880s, and judging by her writings Una Taylor was no devout believer either. Nonetheless, their inclusion of a chorus of nuns praying for Guenever’s redemption in an explicitly Christian language indicates, like the opera’s reluctance to fully celebrate Guenever and Lancelot’s illicit love, an attempt to Anglify Wagner – to make a Wagnerian scenario more palatable for an English audience.<a id="_ftnref70" href='#_ftn70'>[70]</a></p>
    <p>Eichner also notes that in these post-Wagnerian redemption finales the death of the protagonist is often tied to a ‘higher purpose’.<a id="_ftnref71" href='#_ftn71'>[71]</a> In <em>Guenever</em> there is indeed a death tied to a higher purpose, however, it is not that of the eponymous protagonist but rather that of Arthur, which occurs at the end of the penultimate act. The opera is somewhat unusual, then, in having, in a sense, two finales: the end of Acts III and IV. Across these two finales are split, on the one hand, the death linked to the (Christian) redemption of an individual (Act IV), and, on the other hand, the death linked to a ‘higher’ cause: the future redemption of a nation (Act III). However, the distinction between the two endings is not clear-cut because the orchestral music in the very last bars of the opera evokes King Arthur once more. This has the effect of subtly linking the death of Arthur, the ideal he represents and its possible future rebirth with the death and redemption of Guenever.</p>
    
    <h2>1.4 The Regeneration Strand: The Death of Arthur/The Return of Arthur</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">While the first, <em>Tristan</em>-esque strand of Wagnerism running through <em>Guenever</em> focusses mainly on inward human emotions, desires and conflicts, the second focus of the opera, inspired by both Malory and Tennyson, suggests parallels with Wagnerian themes that have much wider political and national implications. This aspect of the opera is linked to Arthur’s death and the associated collapse of his kingdom and the dissolution of the Fellowship of the Round Table. As in Malory’s <em>Le Morte</em> and Tennyson’s <em>Idylls</em>, this dissolution is also entwined with Guenever and Lancelot’s adulterous love, which is both a cause and symptom of a kingdom in decline.<a id="_ftnref72" href='#_ftn72'>[72]</a> In both Malory and Tennyson, Arthur’s death is symbolic of the ‘destruction of an ideal’ and the end of an age,<a id="_ftnref73" href='#_ftn73'>[73]</a> but also offers a glimmer of hope. Christine Poulson writes that for British artists of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries ‘the subject of Arthur’s death was so attractive because he does <em>not</em> die, or at least, because his death contains the promise of return and rebirth’.<a id="_ftnref74" href='#_ftn74'>[74]</a> In Tennyson this is signified by the rising of the sun ‘bringing in the new year’ at the end of the ‘The Passing of Arthur’,<a id="_ftnref75" href='#_ftn75'>[75]</a> an image of ‘renewal and rebirth, of continuity and recurrence’.<a id="_ftnref76" href='#_ftn76'>[76]</a></p>
    <p>      If the link between Arthur’s world in the <em>Idylls</em> and Tennyson’s modern-day Britain is only implicit, then the poet made it clear in the epilogue he added to the collection in 1873, entitled ‘To the Queen’.<a id="_ftnref77" href='#_ftn77'>[77]</a> In this poem Tennyson addresses Queen Victoria directly, praises Britain’s ‘ocean-empire with her boundless homes’ and issues a warning to contemporary Britain: ‘Sense [is] at war with Soul’ and Victorian Britons should be on the side of ‘Soul’ (Arthur) rather than ‘Sense’ (associated above all with Guinevere) if they want the great modern-day Round Table – the British Empire – to avoid the fate of Arthur’s fellowship.<a id="_ftnref78" href='#_ftn78'>[78]</a> The epilogue thus clearly aligns the promised new order arising from the old and the image of hope (the rising sun) at the end of Tennyson’s poem, with nineteenth-century Britain. The relevance of these ideas to Parry and Taylor’s opera becomes apparent at the end of Act III of <em>Guenever</em>, most significantly during a solo section sung by Arthur, which I will refer to as ‘Arthur’s Vision’, in which the King envisages a future Britain in which his ideal has been restored. This passage will be discussed in greater detail below, but first it is necessary to consider how these themes of collapse and renewal constitute another strand of Wagnerism running through <em>Guenever</em>.</p>
    <p>This strand of Wagnerism intersects most clearly with the <em>Ring</em> cycle and to some extent with <em>Parsifal</em>. As Maike Oergel has observed, there exist various broad parallels, in content and intention, between Tennyson’s <em>Idylls of the King</em> and Wagner’s <em>Ring</em>,<a id="_ftnref79" href='#_ftn79'>[79]</a> and there are specific parallels between Arthur and Wotan in the respective works of Tennyson and Wagner: both ‘are motivated by the desire to found a satisfactory society for humanity and both find their desires frustrated by the nature of reality’.<a id="_ftnref80" href='#_ftn80'>[80]</a> Moreover, while Wotan is a God, Arthur is presented by Tennyson as both God-like and Christ-like,<a id="_ftnref81" href='#_ftn81'>[81]</a> as demonstrated most by Tennyson’s description of him as ‘Ideal manhood closed in real man’.<a id="_ftnref82" href='#_ftn82'>[82]</a> In the Wagnerian sphere, then, Arthur has parallels not just with Wotan but also with Parsifal – another Christ-like figure who finds himself in a previously ideal world that has been corrupted by the sexual iniquities of others, and who returns after a long absence to restore that realm to perfection.</p>
    <p>More important than these specific similarities between characters are the broader parallels between the destruction and corruption of worlds and their (promised) regeneration. The cyclical aspect of Tennyson’s <em>Idylls</em> can also be found in the <em>Ring</em> and <em>Parsifal</em>. This is in part because of all three works’ foundation in myth, in which a linear notion of time is replaced with a circular one. At the end of <em>Götterdämmerung</em> a great fire and deluge bring about the end of the world (or the end of <em>a</em> world), the collapse of the Hall of the Gibichungs and Valhalla, and the death of all the main protagonists of the cycle. At the same time, the ring is returned to the Rhine and the world is restored to its natural status – as it was at the start of <em>Das Rheingold</em>. The destruction of the world at the end of the <em>Ring</em>, then, is simultaneously pregnant with the possibility of its renewal – the narrative presented here is cyclical, as in Aidan Thomson’s reading of <em>Parsifal</em> (see the Introduction).<a id="_ftnref83" href='#_ftn83'>[83]</a> Warren Darcy has also highlighted the cyclical aspect of the <em>Ring</em>,<a id="_ftnref84" href='#_ftn84'>[84]</a> and noted that by leaving the stage ‘filled with men and women’ staring up at the fire in the heavens at the end of the drama, Wagner intended to represent his audience:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>humanity at large, to whom Wagner has given the task and, as he felt, the <em>means</em> of transforming society. If we fail to do this, he implies, the cataclysm that ends the world of the <em>Ring</em> will end our world as well.<a id="_ftnref85" href='#_ftn85'>[85]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>There is a parallel here with Tennyson’s warning to nineteenth-century Britain in his epilogue to <em>Idylls of the King</em>. Although both the <em>Idylls</em> and Wagner’s <em>Ring</em> are cyclical <em>within themselves</em>, they are not entirely pessimistic or anti-progress.<a id="_ftnref86" href='#_ftn86'>[86]</a> Tennyson and Wagner both reach out to their audience with the aim of encouraging them to break free from perpetual collapse and destruction. Thus, the potential for progress – a chance to escape the circularity of myth – exists outside of the works themselves, in the real world. There is at the very least a suggestion of the potential for <em>progressive</em> cycles in which a society can improve on past mistakes, even if it, too, is ultimately doomed.<a id="_ftnref87" href='#_ftn87'>[87]</a></p>
    <p>      By focussing on Arthur and his eventual passing to Avalon in Act III, and, moreover, by having Arthur foresee a better future world (in ‘Arthur’s Vision’), Parry and Taylor were engaging with a popular nineteenth-century theme, as evidenced by its presence in both Tennyson and Wagner. As explained in the Introduction, however, these themes of collapse and renewal were especially prominent in Wagnerian and post-Wagnerian operas and other musical works composed during the last two decades of the century, further emphasising the need to view <em>Guenever</em> in the context of a broader current of <em>fin-de-siècle</em> Wagnerism. In this respect, then, it is interesting to note the similarities between <em>Guenever</em> and Chausson’s <em>Le roi Arthus</em>, which Chausson began composing in the same year in which Parry finished his work on <em>Guenever</em> (1886). Both operas focus on the same characters;<a id="_ftnref88" href='#_ftn88'>[88]</a> both were inspired in part by Tennyson’s ‘Guinevere’;<a id="_ftnref89" href='#_ftn89'>[89]</a> and both are concerned with Guenevere (or Genièvre) and Lancelot’s adulterous love, the collapse of the Round Table and the promise of regeneration; and both operas display the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites in their depiction of Guenever.<a id="_ftnref90" href='#_ftn90'>[90]</a></p>
    <p>The influence of the Pre-Raphaelites’ Arthurian artworks is also significant in relation to the portrayal and significance of Arthur in <em>Guenever</em>.<a id="_ftnref91" href='#_ftn91'>[91]</a> As the nineteenth century progressed, images of Arthur in fine art became increasingly focussed on his death (or ‘passing’) or pictured him in Avalon, instead of depicting the King as a strong leader at the height of his powers.<a id="_ftnref92" href='#_ftn92'>[92]</a> Perhaps the greatest (certainly the largest) Pre-Raphaelite painting on the theme of Arthur’s passing was Burne-Jones’s <em>The Sleep of Arthur in Avalon</em> (1881–98).<a id="_ftnref93" href='#_ftn93'>[93]</a> This painting represents the same liminal moment at the end of Tennyson’s <em>Idylls</em> and embodies the same promise of renewal at a moment of dissolution. Ayla Lepine observes that this painting embodies a ‘faint but present hope of resurrection’, and Arthur’s body is ‘resonant with death and regeneration’,<a id="_ftnref94" href='#_ftn94'>[94]</a> and Burne-Jones himself wrote in February 1893 that Arthur will one day ‘come back out of his restful sleep’.<a id="_ftnref95" href='#_ftn95'>[95]</a> </p>
    <p>      The popularity of the image of the ‘Fallen Hero’ was in part a reflection of an increasing scepticism of the Victorian age’s ability to revive and embody the principles of chivalry: ‘the culmination of manly virtue, incorporating a high sense of honor, a disdain for danger and death, a taste for adventure, vast compassion for those inferior in prowess or social standing, self-sacrifice, and altruism’.<a id="_ftnref96" href='#_ftn96'>[96]</a> Debra Mancoff notes that the ‘height of the Arthurian Revival’ also marked ‘the decline of revivalist chivalry as comparison with the ideal [chivalric Arthurian world] increasingly diminished rather than ennobled reality’.<a id="_ftnref97" href='#_ftn97'>[97]</a> Pictures of the dying or passing King Arthur represented not so much a ‘rejection of the chivalric ideal, but a resignation to its inherent futility’ in the modern age.<a id="_ftnref98" href='#_ftn98'>[98]</a></p>
    <p>      Considering the ways in which Parry and Taylor’s opera engages with the concept of chivalry is important for understanding of <em>Guenever</em>’s relationship with Wagner because chivalry was no less pertinent to Wagner’s <em>Parsifal</em> and its Arthurian source – Wolfram von Eschenbach’s <em>Parzival</em> – than it was a prominent theme of Malory and Tennyson’s versions of the legends.<a id="_ftnref99" href='#_ftn99'>[99]</a> Aidan Thomson has written that Wagner was the German composer ‘most associated with “nobility”’ – and thus also with chivalry and knightliness – at the end of the nineteenth century. <em>Parsifal</em>, Thomson notes, inspired a number of ‘knightly’ operas during this period, including Strauss’s <em>Guntram</em> (1894), Pfitzner’s <em>Der arme Heinrich</em> (1895), and the Arthurian operas of Goldmark and Rüfer.<a id="_ftnref100" href='#_ftn100'>[100]</a> Like <em>Parsifal</em>, many of these operas foregrounded the theme of ‘regeneration’, which in <em>Parsifal</em> ‘manifested itself in self-denial (or sexual repression) <em>within</em> (not transforming) an existing hierarchy characterized by homosocial patriarchalism’.<a id="_ftnref101" href='#_ftn101'>[101]</a> This ‘metaphor of chivalry’, as Thomson refers to it, was absorbed by various Wagnerian composers in the period around the turn of the century. One more context in which to view <em>Guenever</em>, then, is in relation to these post-Parsifalian works that either affirm or critique the ideal of chivalry presented in Wagner’s last music drama. Like so many other aspects of <em>Guenever</em>, however, the opera’s attitude towards chivalry is ambiguous.</p>
    <p>      Conventional chivalric values are embodied in the opera not only by Arthur but by the short-lived character of Gareth in Act I. Gareth’s chivalric nature in <em>Guenever</em> is suggested by both his actions and his music. In stark contrast to the anti-chivalric Mordred, Gareth is reluctant to go ahead with the execution of Guenever from the very beginning. When Guenever asks if ‘there is not one knightly man will hold me innocent?’, it is Gareth who replies ‘Yea Queen, I me repent!’. When Lancelot is heard rushing towards the scene, Gareth begins to untie Guenever from the stake in order to assist her rescue, but he is then struck down by Lancelot. In true chivalric fashion, Gareth is merciful, tries to protect a lady in distress, and in his intentions at least remains loyal to his King and to Lancelot.</p>
    <p>      The music associated with Gareth further highlights his chivalric character. In relation to the music of Elgar, the English composer most associated with the concept of chivalry, Matthew Riley has identified a distinctly ‘chivalrous rhetoric’: ‘a rhetoric whose vocabulary is based on pacing rhythms and the imitation of courtly gestures’, in addition to ‘leaping and flourishing motifs, diatonic harmony, a steady marching bass and conspicuous brass’.<a id="_ftnref102" href='#_ftn102'>[102]</a> One particular kind of chivalric musical gesture identified by Riley comprises ‘a melodic line [that] suggests an elaborate courtly bow by dipping gently before rising swiftly with a flourish’.<a id="_ftnref103" href='#_ftn103'>[103]</a> The ‘Gareth’ leitmotif (Ex. 1.7) follows a broadly similar pattern: after an initial octave leap down there is an ascending flourish with accelerating dotted rhythms. Fragmented versions of the rising dotted figure, representative of Gareth’s good knightly character, are prominent during his appearances throughout the rest of Act I and near the start of Act II as his corpse is carried into the hall by a group of knights. Ex. 1.8 shows the use of this fragment of the ‘Gareth’ motif later in Act I at the point Gareth promises to protect Guenever and is restrained by Mordred’s men. This example also illustrates Parry’s use of a steady marching bass – another typical characteristic of chivalrous rhetoric – in combination with the rising dotted motif.<a id="_ftnref104" href='#_ftn104'>[104]</a></p>
    <p>      The ‘Gareth’ motif acquires its chivalric association not just through its bow-like flourish but also, arguably, because its general contour and rhetoric seem to allude to the opening of the <em>Meistersinger</em> Overture: both begin with a strong downbeat followed by a leap downwards, a dotted rhythm and finally a stepwise ascent. As with the Arthurian Knights of the Round Table, the artists and craftspeople who make up the medieval guild of Wagner’s Mastersingers are united by a bond of fellowship and brotherly love, a bond which is also to some extent chivalric.<a id="_ftnref105" href='#_ftn105'>[105]</a> Furthermore, the supposedly muscular diatonicism of <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, a work which Parry described as Wagner’s ‘most genial, warm-hearted masterpiece’,<a id="_ftnref106" href='#_ftn106'>[106]</a> complements the image of the manly chivalric knight. The muscular diatonic ‘Lancelot’ motif (Ex. 1.4, bb. 7–10) also alludes to the opening gesture of <em>Die Meistersinger</em> through its accented first note, leap downward to a repeated note with a dotted rhythm and subsequent rising and falling patterns with contrary motion between the outer parts. But if Lancelot’s music and its faint allusions to Wagnerian motifs with chivalric associations suggest that he too is an exemplar of chivalry, his actual actions in the opera do not always support this.</p>

    </div> 

    <p>Indeed, there are various ways in which <em>Guenever</em> seems to question the chivalric ideal. First, the emphasis on and agency granted to the female characters of the opera – Guenever and Lyones – contrasts with the ‘homosocial patriarchalism’ that Thomson observes in the community of the Grail Knights in <em>Parsifal</em> and which is also apparent in the chivalric Arthurian universes of Malory and Tennyson. Second, the two most chivalrous characters (Gareth and Arthur) die before the start of the final act. Finally, in the case of Lancelot, although his recue of Guenever and some of his other acts and words in the opera are undoubtedly chivalrous, he ultimately betrays his knightly values by refusing to repent for his illicit relationship with Guenever. He even tempts Guenever away from her repentant life at the nunnery.</p>
    <p>That Parry should have contributed to, or at least agreed on, a scenario that questions the legitimacy of chivalric values might be explained, in part, by his antipathy towards the upper-class Victorian values and mannerisms that were associated with chivalry during the nineteenth century. The sanitised image of the chivalric knight of Arthurian mythology had become, by the middle of the century, closely identified with that of the aristocratic ‘gentleman’,<a id="_ftnref107" href='#_ftn107'>[107]</a> a word that Parry disliked because the uncertainty of its meaning led to the ‘very impudent assumption of empty superiority of so-called rank and moneyed position’.<a id="_ftnref108" href='#_ftn108'>[108]</a> Parry, a committed liberal with a strong dislike of Toryism, might also have acquired a distaste for the notion of chivalry due to the fact that it had been appropriated by the politics of the Young England movement in the 1840s which promoted neofeudalism and ‘sought to make the chivalric ideal a modern reality through true acts of <em>noblesse oblige</em>’.<a id="_ftnref109" href='#_ftn109'>[109]</a></p>

    <p>There were some aspects of Arthurian chivalry that would have appealed to Parry, however, in particular the fellowship among the knights and the selflessness of the ideal man embodied in King Arthur. In these elements, Parry must have recognised the parallels with Christianity, such as the similarities between King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, and Christ and the disciples. Although Parry was dismissive of the supernatural, mystical and ritualistic aspects of Christianity, he praised (using a Wagnerian phrase) its ‘purely human aspects’ and the ‘brotherhood of man’ that it promoted. In relation to Bach’s presentation of the story of Christ’s crucifixion in the <em>St Matthew Passion</em>, for example, Parry wrote that it illustrated ‘the highest state which mankind can attain’.<a id="_ftnref110" href='#_ftn110'>[110]</a> It might well have been this ‘highest state’ of mankind that Parry identified in King Arthur and with the whole Arthurian world before its corruption – a true ‘brotherhood of man’.<a id="_ftnref111" href='#_ftn111'>[111]</a> Thus, although Parry would not have wanted to portray modern-day Britain as the fulfilment of the promise of Arthur’s return, he could have still held out hope of mankind attaining the Arthurian ideal in the future. After all, Parry’s enthusiasm for the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer encouraged a belief in progress in all spheres of life.<a id="_ftnref112" href='#_ftn112'>[112]</a></p>
    <p>If, like much else in <em>Guenever</em>, the opera’s attitude towards chivalry, and the Parsifalian kind of regeneration associated with it, is ultimately ambiguous, Arthur’s status as a Parsifal-like saviour is made clear by a musical allusion to Wagner’s last work. Arthur’s ideal God-/Christ-like status is suggested by the leitmotif associated with him. This music is first heard at the instruction ‘Enter Arthur’ in Act II (Ex. 1.9), and its likeness to the so-called ‘Grail’ motif from <em>Parsifal</em> is immediately apparent. Both the rhythm and harmonic progression (I-vi-IV) of the first four chords of the ‘Arthur’ motif (as it first appears in bb. 3–4 of Ex. 1.9) are identical to that of the ‘Grail’ motif, though here in the key of Eb major rather than the opening Ab major of <em>Parsifal</em>. When the ‘Arthur’ motif is repeated a few bars later in Db major the similarity is even more apparent because the upper voice in the last two chords uses the same scale degrees as the ‘Grail’ motif (6–1<span class="comment">use scale degree symbols?</span>). While the ‘Dresden Amen’ part of ‘Grail’ motif is not so clearly alluded to in Parry’s motif, the ascending motion of the music in the three bars just after the second statement of the dotted motif (bb. 7–9 of Ex. 1.9) creates something of the same effect.<a id="_ftnref113" href='#_ftn113'>[113]</a> In <em>Guenever</em> this music is no longer associated with the physical object of the Grail, but the broader religious and idealistic associations of the Grail are carried over from <em>Parsifal</em> and attached instead to the character of Arthur, who, like the Grail, embodies an ideal. </p>
    <p>The function of Arthur’s motif in <em>Guenever</em> invites comparison with a motif found in Chausson’s Arthurian opera, first heard at fig. 3 of the prelude. That motif, too, comprises an ascending motion that seems to allude to the rising Dresden Amen music of the ‘Grail’ motif, and when a version of it appears in the final bars of the opera it encapsulates and reaffirms the ideal that Arthus represents.<a id="_ftnref114" href='#_ftn114'>[114]</a> The instrumental music accompanying the procession of Guenever’s body at the conclusion of Parry’s opera (Ex. 1.6) similarly refers back to the ‘Arthur’ motif, specifically to the ascending pattern found in bars 7–9 of Ex. 1.9. The music highlighted by the bracket in Ex. 1.6 displays the same largely stepwise ascent to the third scale degree as the music from Arthur’s first entrance. This optimistic rising gesture at the end of the opera thus reinforces the promise of the future return of the Arthurian ideal. This return is first suggested in the libretto in ‘Arthur’s Vision’ at the end of Act III (see below), but is here indicated by purely musical means. It is Parry’s version of Tennyson’s rising sun at the end of the <em>Idylls</em>.</p>
    
    <caption><strong>Example 1.</strong>  Parry, <em>Guenever</em>, Act II, ‘Arthur’ and ‘Mordred’ motifs</caption>

    <p>It is not only the motivic aspect of <em>Guenever</em>’s conclusion that promises the return of Arthur (or his ideal) but also its tonality of Eb major. The use of the key of Eb in association with Arthur is significant both intratextually and intertextually. Intertextually, this key would have been most strongly associated in the 1880s with Beethoven’s ‘Eroica’ Symphony and the flowing waters of the Rhine in the prelapsarian world at the opening of Wagner’s <em>Das Rheingold</em>. It thus emphasises both Arthur’s heroism and his status of purity. Within <em>Guenever</em> itself, Eb is employed not just at Arthur’s first entrance and at the opera’s conclusion, but also during ‘Arthur’s Vision’ in Act III (Ex. 1.10). Though only short in length, this section is of great significance, and the <em>forte</em> two-bar instrumental passages at bb. 11–12 and 21–2 of Ex. 1.10 constitute some of the most triumphant music in the whole work. ‘Arthur’s Vision’ begins with the King instructing his Knights not to grieve his declining state, before he describes what appears to be a vision of a future in which ‘all strife is over’ and an idyllic state has been restored: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Grieve not. </p>
      <p>To Eastward and to Westward, </p>
      <p>With eyes no longer dim, </p>
      <p>I see the land I have longed for, </p>
      <p>Through the storm clouds’ broken rim. </p>
      <p>Warted and rent and barren, </p>
      <p>Dry branches bloom and root. </p>
      <p>They revive to leafage and blossom, </p>
      <p>And the stunted boughs bear fruit! </p>
      <p>I see the fair fields ripen, </p>
      <p>And the reapers gather grain, </p>
      <p>Where late the field was blackened, </p>
      <p>By the heaps of many slain.</p>
      <p>But now all strife is over, </p>
      <p>And lips long songless sing, </p>
      <p>And peace her blessing showeth,</p>
      <p>On the land where I once was King.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The nature and seasonal imagery is typical of the Arthurian tradition represented in Malory and Tennyson, in which the decline of Arthur’s Kingdom corresponds with the season of winter at the end of year’s cycle. The text of ‘Arthur’s Vision’ similarly makes connections between storm clouds, winter and death, and between spring, flowering and new life – and in this case a new regenerated, redeemed world. Arthur is not describing something he can see in front of him at that moment but rather a prophecy of things to come. The tonality of this section places ‘Arthur’s Vision’ in the middle of the development of a chain ideas linked by Eb major at three important moments of the opera: first, Arthur’s entrance in Act II – the introduction of Arthur as the embodiment of an ideal through his motif’s association with <em>Parsifal</em>’s ‘Grail’ motif; second, ‘Arthur’s Vision’, Act III – a textual prediction of the return of the Arthurian ideal linked to Arthur’s key of Eb; and, finally, the concluding bars, Act IV – a musical affirmation of this future renewal with both motivic and tonal reference to Arthur’s first entrance.</p>
    <p>In fact, Eb major establishes itself shortly before the closing instrumental music: it is the tonality of the preceding Nuns’ chorus in which the nuns pray for Guenever’s redemption in heaven. Consequently, Eb major gains further associations not just with Guenever’s redemption but with heaven itself, a connection which then links Paradise with the promised renewal of the Arthurian ideal – with a regenerated future Britain. This coincides with Guenever’s redemption because it is only when her sin has been forgiven that regeneration can be achieved. It also worth noting that in terms of conventional tonal relationships – the circle of fifths – Eb major is distant from the D major of the lovers’ duet, and is literally, and in this case morally, ‘higher’ than D major. To return, then, to the question of whether <em>Guenvever</em> affirms or critiques the chivalric model presented in <em>Parsifal</em>, it would seem that ultimately it upholds it through the music association with Arthur, but perhaps only as something to aspire to rather than as a reality that can be attained.</p>

    <p>The extent to which the renewal promised in ‘Arthur’s Vision’ and at the end of the opera is imagined as a specifically national (British or English), rather than universal, regeneration is not entirely clear, but there is a reference to the geographical location of the opera at the start of Act I: ‘Outside Chester walls’.<a id="_ftnref115" href='#_ftn115'>[115]</a> Chester, located directly on the border between England and Wales – on the fringe of the Celtic Fringe – is a liminal location like the settings of many Wagnerian/post-Wagnerian regeneration operas. Moreover, the places and landscapes near the Welsh border later took on great significance in the music of the so-called English Musical Renaissance. Usually, however, it was the southern end of the English/Welsh border – the areas surrounding the Severn River – that served as inspiration for composers such as Elgar, Howells and Gurney.<a id="_ftnref116" href='#_ftn116'>[116]</a> As ‘the topographical and cultural frontier between Saxon and Celt’,<a id="_ftnref117" href='#_ftn117'>[117]</a> these were locations where two worlds elided. Composers could imagine them as sites where a distinctive Britishness was born out of a synthesis of the enchanted spirit of the mythical Celts and the more rational values of the Saxons.<a id="_ftnref118" href='#_ftn118'>[118]</a> In this respect, the English-Welsh border area could be viewed as a microcosm of Britain’s position in Europe as a whole when viewed through an Arthurian lens. Sam Smiles writes that</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Britain seen under Arthurian aspect, is poised at the western limits of the intelligible world. To the east, Europe, history and doctrine, birthplace of classical civilization and the <em>logos</em>; to the west, ocean, myth and mysticism, limitless and transcendental. The importance of the Arthurian tradition is its reconciliation of these understandings of the world.<a id="_ftnref119" href='#_ftn119'>[119]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The beginning of ‘Arthur’s Vision’, specifically the words ‘To Eastward and to Westward / […] I see the land I have longed for’, could well be interpreted in this light – as an indication that in his imagined future utopia the mysterious Celtic West and the enlightened civilised East have been united. In any case, by situating <em>Guenever</em> on the English-Welsh border, Parry and Taylor’s opera becomes one that is concerned with nation. </p>
    
    <h2>1.5 Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">When Dannreuther remarked that <em>Guenever</em> was ‘the real English opera for which we have waited for so long’,<a id="_ftnref120" href='#_ftn120'>[120]</a> one suspects that what he really meant was that it was the first real English Wagnerian opera. Many of the elements of <em>Guenever</em> that make it a specifically English or British opera,<a id="_ftnref121" href='#_ftn121'>[121]</a> however, are actually those aspects that illustrate a resistance to or tempered assimilation of Wagnerian techniques and ideas, or are in fact universal themes situated in a national context. The popularity of Arthurian legends in nineteenth-century Britain was in part precisely because of their ability to be at once national and universal,<a id="_ftnref122" href='#_ftn122'>[122]</a> and many of Wagner’s mythological works, and those of his followers, achieved this same fusion. The two strands of Wagnerism found in <em>Guenever</em> are also typical of this duality: while Guenever and Lancelot’s adulterous love is problematised in a way that suggests anxieties relating to Victorian morality, the themes of love, guilt and redemption that are prominent are common to late nineteenth-century Wagnerian works by composers from across Europe. Similarly, although the narrative of Arthur’s death and the promised return of his ideal is connected specifically to Britain, such themes of regeneration, and even specifically Arthurian regeneration, were not limited to British musical Wagnerian works, as Chausson’s <em>Le roi Arthus</em> illustrates.</p>
    <p>Nonetheless, <em>Guenever</em> anticipates a number of the common themes of later manifestations of British musical Wagnerism. These include the two strands discussed in detail here: the illicit love associated with a <em>Tristan</em>-esque love triangle, guilt and redemption; and the theme of the destruction and (promised) regeneration of societies and worlds. Aspects of the first strand are found again in Bantock’s <em>Caedmar</em>, Boughton’s <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> and Bax’s <em>Tintagel</em>. The national regeneration theme, meanwhile, is present in the works of Elgar, Boughton, Holbrooke and Bax. <em>Guenever</em> also anticipates the Arthurian operas of Boughton; its vague Celticism predates the more explicitly Celtic Wagnerian works of Bantock and Holbrooke, among others; and its links with Pre-Raphaelite art highlight the frequent intermedial relationships and exchanges that were characteristic of <em>fin-de-siècle</em> Wagnerism, and which are found again in the Pre-Raphaelite inspired Wagnerian symphonic poems of William Wallace. Equally, there were later aspects of British musical Wagnerism that were alien to <em>Guenever</em>: the mysticism of Wallace’s <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em> and Elgar’s <em>Dream of Gerontius</em>, for instance, and the more overtly political Wagnerism of Boughton.</p>
    <p>Parry’s failure to have the opera produced in England or abroad meant that <em>Guenever</em> played no material role in promoting or shaping British Wagnerism over the next few years. But its intersection with so many aspects of later Wagnerian works by British composers highlights the fact that British musical Wagnerism was a coherent phenomenon shaped and characterised by a number of common themes and influences. If, ultimately, <em>Guenever</em> was something of a false start to British musical Wagnerism, it was not long before other British composers injected new momentum into the movement in the 1890s and 1900s. The Wagnerism of one of these composers, Edward Elgar, was complex and multifaceted, and a number of his orchestral and choral works composed during the two decades after Parry ceased work on <em>Guenever</em> illustrate an aspect of his Wagnerism that has been largely overlooked before now, and which was to a certain degree also anticipated in Parry’s Arthurian opera in the form of ideas about fellowship and community.</p>

      <p>[<a id="_ftn1" href='#_ftnref1'>1]</a> Parry began the sketches for the opera on 20 June 1884 and after various periods of activity and inactivity (including a trip to South America between June and September 1885) he completed a short score in May 1886. This manuscript is now held at the Royal College of Music where the acts have not been bound together in the correct order: Acts III and IV are the wrong way round and the end of Act II is bound to the end of Act I. It is complete except for what is probably only a few pages of instrumental music at the conclusion of Act III. Royal College of Music, MS 4194.

S. Brewer, 2002), 35–50. Dibble notes that ‘a comparison of Parry’s vocal-score reductions with full scores show that he was in the habit of omitting important elements such as florid inner parts or essential suspensions’, and thus it is likely that, in places, there are various inner parts and other aspects of the music missing from the surviving score of <em>Guenever</em> that would have been realised in full score.

      <p>[<a id="_ftn18" href='#_ftnref18'>18]</a> Debra Mancoff writes that ‘Wagner’s effect on the [Arthurian] tradition was so profound that composers of subsequent generations found it impossible to separate his contribution from earlier convention’. Debra N. Mancoff, ‘Introduction’, in Debra N. Mancoff (ed.), <em>The Arthurian Revival: Essays on Form, Tradition, and Transformation</em> (London: Routledge, 1992), xi–xxii at xviii. The other European Arthurian operas include Ernest Chausson’s <em>Le roi Arthus</em> (1886–95); Philipp Rüfer’s <em>Merlin</em> (prem. 1887); Isaac Albéniz’s <em>Merlin</em> (1897–1902); and Marcel Samuel-Rousseau’s <em>Le roi Arthur</em> (1903). </p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn19" href='#_ftnref19'>19]</a> In Britain, Parry’s Arthurian operatic venture was preceded by Frederick Corder’s musically conservative number opera <em>Morte d’Arthur</em>, excerpts of which were performed in 1879. Parry was certainly not the last British composer to combine Arthurian themes with Wagnerism, as evidenced by Boughton’s Arthurian cycle (see Chapter 4), Elgar’s incidental music for Arthurian play by Laurence Binyon in 1923, and Bax’s tone poem <em>Tintagel</em> (see Chapter 6). There were also Arthurian operas by lesser known composers, including two dating from 1897 entitled <em>King Arthur</em> by Colin MacAlpin and the Welsh composer Joseph Parry respectively, in addition to an opera by Vincent Thomas, apparently a bank clerk, entitled <em>Gwenevere</em> (1905). For further details regarding these three operas, see Paul Rodmell, <em>Opera in the British Isles, 1875–1918</em> (Farnham: Ashgate, 2013), 272–3, 295, 325–6. For an extensive list of Arthurian music, from Britain and beyond, see Jerome V. Reel, ‘A Listing of Arthurian Music’, in Barber (ed.), <em>King Arthur in Music</em>, 161–88; and Jerome V. Reel, ‘The Music of Arthur: A Listing’, <em>The Camelot Project</em> (2005), <a href='http://d.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/text/the-music-of-arthur-a-listing' target='_blank' class='url'>http://d.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/text/the-music-of-arthur-a-listing</a> (accessed 13 Feb. 2016).</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn20" href='#_ftnref20'>20]</a> Malory’s book was practically forgotten for two centuries until the 1817 publication of the work, edited by Robert Southey, which preserved the original medieval English and was based on the fifteenth-century Caxton edition. Thomas Malory, <em>The Byrth, Lyf and Actes of King Arthur</em>, ed. Robert Southey (London: Longman &amp; Co., 1817). It was this edition that Burne-Jones discovered in a bookshop in 1855 and which subsequently served as a source of great inspiration to him, William Morris, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and the Pre-Raphaelites and the Arthurian revival more generally. In the second half of the century, modern language editions of the book were published, thus widening the book’s readership and popularity so that by the last quarter of the century it was circulating as much as Tennyson’s <em>Idylls</em>. See Debra N. Mancoff, <em>The Arthurian Revival in Victorian Art</em> (New York; London: Garland, 1990), 210.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn21" href='#_ftnref21'>21]</a> Tennyson’s work on <em>Idylls of the King</em> spanned from 1833 to 1891, though the bulk of the poems were published in two volumes, the first in 1859 (‘Enid’, ‘Vivien’, ‘Elaine’ and ‘Guinevere’ – the first three of these were later renamed and, in the case of ‘Enid’, split in two) and the second in 1869 (‘The Coming of Arthur’, ‘The Holy Grail’, ‘Pelleas and Ettarre’ and ‘The Passing of Arthur’ – the latter was based on Tennyson’s earlier poem ‘Morte d’Arthur’, first published in 1842). ‘Gareth and Lynette’ and ‘The Last Tournament’ were published in 1872, and ‘Balin and Balan’ in 1885.</p>

Michael Allis writes that Parry’s rather Wagnerian ‘reading list of 1884 encompassed several mythological sources, including Magnusson and Morris’s translations of the Icelandic myths <em>Grettis Saga</em> and <em>The Saga of Fridthjof the Bold</em>, Lady Charlotte Guest’s translation of the <em>Mabinogion</em>, Malory’s <em>Le Morte d’Arthur</em>, and the <em>Prose Edda</em>’.

Not long after the <em>Guenever</em> project was over, Parry moved into a house opposite Burne-Jones on Kensington Square in late 1886. When Burne-Jones died in 1898 Parry organised the music for his memorial service in Westminster Abbey. Parry’s first biographer, Charles L. Graves, noted that the composer ‘admired William Morris as an artist and a man’, and Parry’s daughter, Dolly, listed Burne-Jones and Morris as some of her father’s close friends. Parry was also familiar with works by John Everett Millais, G. F. Watts, Swinburne and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, of whom he wrote: ‘The man is a tremendous power of a sort—colourist and sensualist’. Graves, <em>Hubert Parry</em>, vol. I, 244, 270–1; Dibble, <em>C. Hubert Parry: His Life and Music</em>, 247–8, 356, 499. Dannreuther was also well-acquainted with Morris and Rossetti, and he even set some Pre-Raphaelite verse to music in 1884. See Dibble, ‘Edward Dannreuther and the Orme Square Phenomenon’, 278; and Susan Parsons, ‘The Pre-Raphaelites and Music’, <em>Journal of the British Music Society</em>, 6 (1984), 1–18 at 3.</p>

      <p>[<a id="_ftn26" href='#_ftnref26'>26]</a> There is also a motif associated with the fire and the baying crowd of the first act that returns in the love duet when Lancelot reminds Guenever of how he rescued her, but this functions as a reminiscence motif rather than as a Wagnerian leitmotif. Parry’s extensive study of Wagner’s scores meant that he was well acquainted with Wagner’s leitmotivic technique, and he even wrote the entry on ‘Leit-motif’ for Grove’s <em>Dictionary of Music and Musicians</em>, describing them as ‘short passages of melody of marked character which illustrate, or as it were label, certain personages, situations, or abstract ideas which occur prominently in the course of a story or drama of which the music is the counterpart’. Parry, ‘Leit-motif’, 115.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn27" href='#_ftnref27'>27]</a> Parry, ‘Leit-motif’, 115. Though the work was not orchestrated, Dibble suggests that Parry probably intended the brass to be associated with Arthur’s motif, the full orchestra with Lancelot’s motif and strings with Guenever’s motif. Dibble, <em>C. Hubert</em> <em>Parry: His Life and Music</em>, 241.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn28" href='#_ftnref28'>28]</a> Associative tonality is discussed in greater detail in relation to Elgar in Chapter 2.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn29" href='#_ftnref29'>29]</a> Dibble observes that while there are some solo sections (such as Guenever’s Act I soliloquy) in which Parry achieves a Wagnerian ‘free prose-like phraseology’, there are equally sections where this is ‘replaced by stereotypical, repetitive, sequential formulae’. Dibble, ‘Parry’s <em>Guenever</em>: Trauma and Catharsis’, 47; Dibble, <em>C. Hubert Parry: His Life and Music</em>, 240.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn30" href='#_ftnref30'>30]</a> This opening chorus is based on the opening lines of Malory’s ‘The Dethe of Arthur’, the final part of <em>Le Morte Darthur</em>: ‘In May whan every harte floryshyth and burgenyth—for as the season ys lusty to beholde and comfortable, so man and woman rejoysyth and gladith of somer commynge with his freyshe floures, for wynter wyth hys rowghe wyndis and blastis causyth lusty men and women to cowre and to sit by fyres’. Stephen H. A. Shepherd (ed.), <em>Sir Thomas Malory, Le Morte Darthur</em> (New York: W. W. Norton, 2004), 646.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn31" href='#_ftnref31'>31]</a> When viewed in this context of a conservative British Wagner reception in the 1880s and 90s, Parry’s <em>Guenever</em> actually emerges as an opera that is relatively less conventional than those of his contemporaries, Stanford and Mackenzie, and his pupil, MacCunn; on a spectrum of ‘third ways’, <em>Guenever</em> lies closer to the end of Wagnerian music drama, at least in terms of its large-scale structure. The opera nonetheless includes a number of sections which are essentially set pieces. The choruses constitute the most obvious examples, but there are also various solo sections that are readily recognisable as distinct ‘numbers’: Guenever’s soliloquies in Acts I and II, Lyones’s lament at the start of Act III, ‘Arthur’s Dream’ towards the end of Act II, ‘Arthur’s Vision’ near the conclusion of Act III, and the love duet of Guenever and Lancelot in the final act.</p>

III: <em>Music in the Nineteenth Century</em> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), 528. John Daverio notes that such procedures are especially common in <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>, a work in which ‘The continual wandering between keys a half-step apart in the central love scene and elsewhere is made possible by the enharmonic equivalence of the dominant-seventh and “German” augmented-sixth chords, the latter implying a key a half-step higher than the former. While Wagner was hardly the first composer to exploit this equivalence, he arguably employed it in <em>Tristan</em> more systematically, and more persistently, than any of his predecessors – a musical conjuror who revelled in unleashing the magic latent in the tonal harmonic system’.

      <p>[<a id="_ftn43" href='#_ftnref43'>43]</a> It is telling that the front cover of Taylor’s 1896 volume of poetry <em>Nets for the Wind</em> featured an illustration by the decadent, Wagnerite, Pre-Raphaelite-influenced artist Aubrey Beardsley. Una Ashworth Taylor, <em>Nets for the Wind</em> (London: John Lane, 1896). Taylor’s interest in Maeterlinck, as illustrated by her book on him, is further evidence of her close affinities with these wider cultural movements.

      <p>[<a id="_ftn44" href='#_ftnref44'>44]</a> Ellis Hanson remarks that ‘Wagner was one of the great inspirations for fin de siècle aestheticism’, and in ‘the great themes of his operas, the decadents recognized their own obsessions in spectacular form’. Ellis Hanson, <em>Decadence and Catholicism</em> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1997), 27, 31. Various aspects of Wagner’s music dramas appealed to the aesthetes, the decadents and the Symbolists: in his book on music and decadence Stephen Downes points to the ‘incredibly powerful impact of the Venusberg music from <em>Tannhäuser</em>, the eroticism-death symbolism of <em>Tristan and Isolde</em>, the image of the debased and degraded Siegfried as he succumbs to the decadent Gibichungs in <em>Twilight of the Gods</em>, the sickness-redemption oppositions in <em>Parsifal</em> and (to a lesser degree) of Wagner’s theoretical writings’. Stephen Downes, <em>Music and Decadence in European Modernism: The Case of Central and Eastern Europe</em> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010), 15.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn45" href='#_ftnref45'>45]</a> Parry would probably not have approved of a scenario that was overtly decadent. A few years after the <em>Guenever</em> project, he wrote suspiciously of an ‘unwholesome [decadent] influence which made some parts of <em>Tannhäuser</em> run very near to vulgarity’, so it is unlikely he would have tolerated such unwholesomeness in an opera of his own.

      <p>[<a id="_ftn49" href='#_ftnref49'>49]</a> The spellings of the lovers’ names are closer to Malory’s (‘Tristram’ and ‘Isode’) than Wagner’s. For the remainder of this chapter I shall use various spellings of ‘Guenever’ and ‘Lancelot’ depending on which author’s work I am referring to at each moment. Thus, in addition to ‘Guenever’ (Parry/Taylor), there is ‘Gwenyver’ (Malory), ‘Guinevere’ (Tennyson) and ‘Guenevere’ (Morris; Rossetti); in addition to ‘Lancelot’ (Parry/Taylor; Tennyson), there is ‘Launcelot’ (Malory; Morris; Rossetti). Parry and Taylor’s spelling of ‘Guenever’ is closest to the Malory-inspired spelling favoured by the Pre-Raphaelites.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn50" href='#_ftnref50'>50]</a> This is essentially what happens in Tennyson’s ‘Guinevere’ in <em>Idylls of the King</em>.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn51" href='#_ftnref51'>51]</a> This is also one of only two parts of the opera to have been recorded. Dibble orchestrated Act I, scene iv of <em>Guenever</em> for a BBC Radio 3 programme: ‘Parry: Composer of the Week’ (‘Fairest Isle’), broadcast on 26 September 1995, performed by Shelley Everall (soprano) and the BBC Concert Orchestra, conducted by Barry Wordsworth. A commercial recording of the Soliloquy (again with Dibble’s orchestration and concert ending) was released in 2009 by Dutton: BBC Concert Orchestra, conducted by Martyn Brabbins, and Susan Gritton (soprano), <em>Her Song: Orchestral Songs and Arias</em>, CDLX 7228 (UK: Dutton, 2009). The other excerpt to have been recorded (also orchestrated by Dibble) is from the end of Act II when Arthur bids farewell to Guenever and then describes a dream he had the previous night. BBC Concert Orchestra, conducted by Martin Yates, Ailish Tynan (soprano), and Roderick Williams (baritone), <em>Sea Fever</em>, CDLX7199 (UK: Dutton, 2007). On the CD this section is described as ‘King Arthur’s Farewell to Guenever’. Here, I will describe the section beginning with the words ‘A dark dream came last night’ as ‘Arthur’s Dream’.</p>

Laura Cooner Lambdin and Robert Thomas Lambdin, <em>Camelot in the Nineteenth Century: Arthurian Characters in the Poems of Tennyson, Arnold, Morris, and Swinburne</em> (London: Greenwood Press, 2000), 76. The Lambdins suggest that Guenevere’s denials of guilt in Morris’s poem are referring only to the specific occasion on which Mordred and the other knights caught Launcelot in the Queen’s chamber (Ibid.). A more convincing reading of ‘The Defence of Guenevere’, taking into account the ‘medieval background of the poem’, argues that Guenevere is not being tried specifically for adultery but rather she ‘is to be burned for treason, for an offense against the kingdom’. Virginia Hale and Catherine Stevenson argue that in the context of courtly love Guenevere is innocent; she simply follows ‘natural law’ over ‘human law’, meaning that she is ‘obliged to answer to the order of the universe by rationally following [her] natural inclinations’. Guenevere’s love for Launcelot is natural and true, and therefore overrides the law of her marriage to Arthur. Viewed in this light she cannot be guilty of treason. Virginia S. Hale and Catherine Barnes Stevenson, ‘Morris’ Medieval Queen: A Paradox Resolved’, <em>Victorian Poetry</em>, 30 (1992), 171–8 at 171–2, 174. See also J. B.

Given that the drawing was exhibited by the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1883, around the same time Parry and Taylor conceived of their opera, it is certainly possible that one or both of them saw it and that it inspired this part of opera’s finale. Graves notes that Parry did indeed see some of Rossetti’s pictures on display at the ‘at the Academy and the Burlington Fine Arts Exhibition’ around this time (as noted above, Parry recorded his impression of Rossetti’s ‘tremendous power of a sort’).

      <p>[<a id="_ftn60" href='#_ftnref60'>60]</a> Beverly Taylor and Elisabeth Brewer argue that Morris’s ‘The Defence of Guenevere’ ‘takes a particular point in the narrative and explores it in psychological terms’; Morris seeks to ‘give expression to inner conflict’.

      <p>[<a id="_ftn65" href='#_ftnref65'>65]</a> On the page of the manuscript at which Guenever’s death begins there is a note reading ‘The fighting ceases (NB! Where is Lancelot all this time?)’.</p>

      <p>[<a id="_ftn72" href='#_ftnref72'>72]</a> In Malory’s version the knights and brothers Gawayne and Gareth recognise that the seeds of the Round Table’s destruction have been sown immediately after Mordred and Aggravayne first report the lovers’ affair to the King at the beginning of ‘The Dethe of Arthur’, and King Arthur later explains that he laments the loss of this ‘fellowship’ of knights far more than Gwenyver’s betrayal. See Shepherd (ed.), <em>Sir Thomas Malory, Le Morte Darthur</em>, 647, 658.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn73" href='#_ftnref73'>73]</a> Helen Cooper observes that ‘Malory’s <em>Morte Darthur</em> is not an exercise in nostalgia for a golden age: it is an account of the destruction of an ideal’. Helen Cooper, ‘Introduction’, in Sir Thomas Malory, <em>La Morte Darthur: The Winchester Manuscript</em>, ed. and abridged with an introduction and notes by Helen Cooper (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), vii–xxii at xii. Similarly, in Tennyson’s ‘The Passing of Arthur’ from the <em>Idylls</em>, Sir Bedivere highlights the broader significance of Arthur’s death when he states that ‘now the whole Round Table is dissolved / Which was an image of the mighty world’. Christopher Ricks (ed.), <em>Tennyson: A Selected Edition</em> (Harlow: Longman, 1989), 971.</p>

Similarly, Malory informs us that King Arthur ‘shall com agayne’, and then quotes the supposed inscription on Arthur’s tomb: ‘HIC IACET ARTHURUS, REX QUONDAM REXQUE FUTURUS’ (‘Here lies Arthur, king once, king to be’). Shepherd (ed.), <em>Sir Thomas Malory, Le Morte Darthur</em>, 689.</p>

As various scholars have pointed out, the <em>Idylls of the King</em> are, as a whole, structured in such a way as to correspond with the passing of the seasons during a year, culminating with the winter of ‘The Passing of Arthur’: ‘Underlying this temporal structure was the allegory of cyclical decline and renewal, implicit in the natural passing of the year, that reinforced the myth of Arthur’s return’. Mancoff, <em>The Arthurian Revival in Victorian Art</em>, 228.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn77" href='#_ftnref77'>77]</a> Ricks (ed.), <em>Tennyson: A Selected Edition</em>, 973–5.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn78" href='#_ftnref78'>78]</a> Jerome H. Buckley wrote in 1960 that ‘the <em>Idylls</em>, which traces the rise of a purposeful order and the gradual catastrophic betrayal of its sustaining idealism, stands as an oblique warning, if not a direct ultimatum, to nineteenth-century England’. Jerome H. Buckley, <em>Tennyson: The Growth of a Poet</em> (London: Oxford University Press, 1960), 193. Cited in Mancoff, <em>The Arthurian Revival in Victorian Art</em>, 215. See also Poulson, <em>The Quest for the Grail</em>, 53.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn79" href='#_ftnref79'>79]</a> She argues that the two works ‘result from the same intellectual and cultural developments and fulfil a similar purpose for the two authors and their readers. […] both works exhibit the mythopoeic impetus that, in its universal aspect, addressed the contemporary metaphysical crisis through a redefinition of literature and history and that, in its particular aspect, grounded itself in definitions of the national and its purpose’. Maike Oergel, <em>The Return of King Arthur and the Nibelungen: National Myth in Nineteenth-Century English and German Literature</em> (Berlin; New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1998), 208.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn80" href='#_ftnref80'>80]</a> Ibid. Oergel is here paraphrasing previous work that has drawn parallels the <em>Ring</em> and the <em>Idylls</em>: Clyde de L. Ryals, <em>From the Great Deep: Essays on Idylls of the King</em> (Athens: Ohio University Press, 1967), 193–4; and Henry van Dyke, <em>The Poetry of Tennyson</em>, 3rd ed. (London: Elkin Matthews, 1893). Ryals observes that, like Wotan in his desire to create a free hero, Arthur wants to control the will of his knights to mould them into the perfect men he wants them to be, but this denies ‘them their own individualities’. Arthur thus faces a paradox: ‘to be morally responsible, power must be self-limiting […] but limited power is a contradiction and, moreover, does not allow the successful accomplishment of that which power desires’ (p. 193).</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn81" href='#_ftnref81'>81]</a> Christine Poulson refers to a scene in Tennyson’s ‘Guinevere’ which illustrates Arthur’s God-like status: Arthur, in his characteristically detached manner, forgives Guinevere for her adultery and states ‘Lo! I forgive thee, as Eternal God / Forgives: do thou for thine own soul the rest’. Poulson also observes that both Arthur and Christ ‘come out of obscurity to fulfil their mission, are betrayed by a close friend or relative, cut down in their prime, and die (or do not die) leaving behind the hope of their return’. Poulson, <em>The Quest for the Grail</em>, 234. </p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn82" href='#_ftnref82'>82]</a> This was the last line Tennyson ever added to <em>Idylls of the King</em>, in 1891 (Parry and Taylor would not have known it when they created <em>Guenever</em>).</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn83" href='#_ftnref83'>83]</a> Dieter Borchmeyer writes that, with this cataclysmic conclusion of the <em>Ring</em> ‘the world is restored to its first, paradisiacal state. By ending, it begins anew’. Dieter Borchmeyer, <em>Drama and the World of Richard Wagner</em>, trans. Daphne Ellis (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2002), 235. Borchmeyer argues that this implicit rebirth is further suggested by the musical motif with which the cycle concludes, often referred to as ‘Redemption through Love’ or (by Wagner himself) as ‘The Glorification of Brünnhilde’. The only other time this motif is heard in the cycle is in <em>Die Walküre</em>, immediately after Sieglinde is informed by Brünnhilde that she is pregnant and that the child shall be named Siegfried – hence the link with (re)birth.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn84" href='#_ftnref84'>84]</a> Warren Darcy, ‘The Pessimism of the <em>Ring</em>’, <em>Opera Quarterly</em>, 4/2 (Aut. 1986), 24–48 at 35.</p>

      <p>[<a id="_ftn86" href='#_ftnref86'>86]</a> It should be noted that some twentieth-century commentators on Tennyson did offer pessimistic or anti-progress interpretations of the <em>Idylls</em>. Jerome Buckley writes that ‘The poem no longer presupposes the early-Victorian idea of progress, […] but a later and gloomier cyclical view of history’. Buckley, <em>Tennyson: The Growth of a Poet</em>, 193–4. Clyde Ryals writes that ‘<em>Idylls of the King</em> denies progress of almost every sort’; ‘Much of the <em>Idylls</em> appears to be the expression of a pessimistic philosophy’. Ryals, however, does suggest that there is a glimmer of hope in the rising sun at the end. Ryals, <em>From the Great Deep: Essays on Idylls of the King</em>, 194, 198.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn87" href='#_ftnref87'>87]</a> Oergel, for instance, writes of Tennyson’s ‘concept of recurring, but potentially progressing, cycles’, which she suggests are ‘informed by the notion of Hegelian cycles tied to the rise and fall of nations or cultures’. Oergel, <em>The Return of King Arthur and the Nibelungen</em>, 226. The intersection of Wagnerism and the idea of cyclical evolution is discussed further, and in relation to Theosophical ideas, in Chapter 6.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn88" href='#_ftnref88'>88]</a> The main characters in Chausson’s opera are Arthus, Lancelot, Genièvre, and to a lesser extent Mordred. However, the character of Lyones is absent from <em>Le roi Arthus</em>, and the cast of the French opera includes the additional characters of Merlin, Lyonnel and Allan, none of whom feature in <em>Guenever</em>.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn89" href='#_ftnref89'>89]</a> Steven Huebner, <em>French Opera at the Fin de Siècle: Wagnerism, Nationalism, and Style</em> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 361–3.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn90" href='#_ftnref90'>90]</a> Huebner rightly points out that Genièvre’s suicide by strangling herself with her long hair is a particularly Pre-Raphaelite kind of imagery: ‘The long-haired winsome temptress in specifically Arthurian or generically medieval settings was a favourite subject of Pre-Raphaelite artists’. Ibid. 364. Chausson, like Parry, also composed a symphonic poem based on Vivien (<em>Viviane</em>, op. 5; 1882), the <em>femme fatale</em> in chief of the Arthurian legends who often appeared in Pre-Raphaelite art.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn91" href='#_ftnref91'>91]</a> Arthurian themes in visual art were popular throughout the nineteenth century and into the twentieth, but they were especially prominent in Pre-Raphaelite pictures. For an extensive list of Arthurian-inspired visual art in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, see Christine Poulson, ‘Arthurian Legend in Fine and Applied Art of the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries: A Subject Index’, <em>Arthurian Literature</em>, 10 (1990), 111–34; and Poulson, ‘Arthurian Legend in Fine and Applied Art of the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries: A Catalogue of Artists’, <em>Arthurian Literature</em>, 9 (1989), 81–142.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn92" href='#_ftnref92'>92]</a> Christine Poulson argues that images of Arthur’s passing were ‘suited to the mood of the fin de siècle’ because, with the century drawing to a close, there was an ‘increased awareness of mortality and transience’. It was ‘a time to contemplate endings as well as the possibility of renewal’, and, as observed above, the legend of Arthur’s death embodied both. Poulson, <em>The Quest for the Grail</em>, 236.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn93" href='#_ftnref93'>93]</a> Burne-Jones’s early work on his painting, then, would have overlapped to some extent with Parry’s work on <em>Guenever</em>. As this was also the time that Parry began to become friendly with Burne-Jones, it is possible that the pair could have discussed the similar subject matter of each other’s works. Graves records instances of the pair evaluating each other’s art in 1888 and 1890, so they could well have been discussing such matters earlier in the 1880s, too. Graves, <em>Hubert Parry</em>, vol. I, 294, 324.</p>

      <p>[<a id="_ftn99" href='#_ftnref99'>99]</a> Mary Cicora notes that in Wolfram’s work the ‘Arthurian knights represent the world of chivalry’, while King Arthur himself ‘represents the entire chivalric worldview’. Mary A. Cicora, ‘The Literary Background of <em>Parsifal</em>’, in William Kinderman and Katherine R. Syer (eds.), <em>A Companion to Wagner’s Parsifal</em> (Woodbridge: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2005), 29–53 at 36–7. Roger Scruton notes that the concept of chivalry also underpins <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>: Wagner was ‘drawn to the chivalric code. He saw, beneath the arbitrary encrustation of adventures and conventions, a profound attempt to reconcile heroic action with erotic passion. The chivalric background to the tale of Tristan and Isolde is therefore preserved in Wagner’s version—less as an observable fact than as a subjective atmosphere, a shared but largely unspoken sense of what matters and why’.

      <p>[<a id="_ftn104" href='#_ftnref104'>104]</a> The steady marching and dotted rhythms are also associated with knights more generally, as evidenced by the music of the Knights’ chorus ‘Bear Forth the Banner’ towards the end of Act II. The motif that is associated with Mordred (Ex. 1.9) may be viewed as an distorted version of the ‘Gareth’ motif, perhaps signifying that Mordred’s knightly values have been corrupted; it displays a similar rising contour and dotted rhythms but it is much more agitated and angular than Gareth’s music.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn105" href='#_ftnref105'>105]</a> Nicholas Vazsonyi notes that the world of <em>Die Meistersinger</em> was viewed by contemporaries as a ‘utopian image of a pre-industrial and ultimately harmonious community […] [which] served as a marker against the encroachment of […] modernity’. It depicts a society that is, then, very similar to the world of King Arthur before its corruption. Nicholas Vazsonyi, ‘Introduction. Die Meistersinger: Performance, History, Representation’, in Vazsonyi (ed.), <em>Wagner’s Meistersinger: Performance, History, Representation</em> (Rochester, N.

      <p>[<a id="_ftn107" href='#_ftnref107'>107]</a> Debra Mancoff notes that the ‘analogy between the knight and the gentleman was made explicit in the writings of Kenelm Henry Digby’ such as <em>Broadstone of Honour, or Rules for the Gentlemen of England</em> (1822).

      <p>[<a id="_ftn111" href='#_ftnref111'>111]</a> Graves notes that Parry regarded the achievement of a ‘brotherhood of nations’ ‘to be the highest aim of human effort’, and art was one tool with which to help bring about this goal. Ibid. 158.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn112" href='#_ftnref112'>112]</a> For Parry’s interest in evolutionary ideas, see Jeremy Dibble, ‘Parry as Historiographer’, in Bennett Zon (ed.), <em>Nineteenth-Century British Music Studies</em>, vol. I (Aldershot: Ashgate, 1999), 37–51; and Zon, ‘From Great Man to Fittest Survivor: Reputation, Recapitulation and Survival in Victorian Concepts of Wagner’s Genius’, 415–45.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn113" href='#_ftnref113'>113]</a> The ‘Arthur’ motif is undoubtedly one of the ‘<em>Parsifal</em> effects’ that Stanford identified in <em>Guenever</em> and wanted Parry to alter. Dibble, <em>C. Hubert Parry: His Life and Music</em>, 236.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn114" href='#_ftnref114'>114]</a> See above, and Huebner<em>, French Opera at the Fin de Siècle,</em> 354.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn115" href='#_ftnref115'>115]</a> The only reference to ‘England’ in the entire libretto is when Mordred’s supporters hail him as ‘England’s lord’ at the end of Act II. There are no references to ‘Britain’ or ‘British’, and the only other specific places referred to are Brittany (Guenever’s Soliloquy, Act I) and Cornwall (the opening chorus of Act II). Chester was not the most obvious choice of setting for the beginning of <em>Guenever</em>. In Malory’s <em>Le Morte Darthur</em> Queen Gwenyver’s burning at the stake is supposed to take place just outside of Carlisle, and Camelot is said to be located in Winchester; in <em>Idylls of the King</em> Arthur is said to have been found washed up ‘upon the sands / Of dark Tintagil’, but the location of Camelot is not made explicit – it is more an imagined ideal than a geographical reality. Tennyson does, however, distinguish Camelot from ‘Caerlyle’ and ‘Caerleon’. The latter, which is referred to on a number of occasions by Malory, too, is not just the name of a village in south-east Wales but also a historic name for the city of Chester. This might explain Parry and Taylor’s setting.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn116" href='#_ftnref116'>116]</a> Robert Stradling writes that ‘the region of Severnside came to be selected as the most significant representational location of the phenomenon known as the “English Musical Renaissance”’.

Similarly, David Martin notes that ‘the “sacred landscapes” evoked by English nostalgia abutted the borders of the Celtic realms, for example the Severn Valley and Gloucester, birthplace of Herbert Howells, Vaughan Williams and Ivor Gurney’. David Martin, ‘The Sound of England’, in Athena S. Leoussi and Steven Grosby (eds.), <em>Nationalism and Ethnosymbolism: History, Culture and Ethnicity in the Formation of Nations</em> (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), 68–83 at 72. </p>

      <p>[<a id="_ftn121" href='#_ftnref121'>121]</a> Such elements include the original language of Guenever – English (although there is a German translation, too); its setting on the Welsh border and the vaguely Celtic associations of this location; its relatively conservative musical style, compared to Wagner’s later music and certain contemporaneous Wagnerian operas from the continent; the Christian context of Guenever’s redemption; the extent to which the illicit love of Guenever and Lancelot is problematised; the opera’s engagement with the notion of chivalry (even if also questioning it); and its connections with a well-established literary, and more recent visual, tradition of British Arthurian art.</p>
      <p>[<a id="_ftn122" href='#_ftnref122'>122]</a> William Gladstone, Parry’s political idol, observed this aspect of the stories when reviewing Tennyson’s <em>Idylls</em> in 1859: ‘The Arthurian Romance has every recommendation that should win its way to the homage of a great poet. It is national: it is Christian. It is also human in the largest and deepest sense; and, therefore, though highly national, it is universal; for it rests upon those depths and breadths of our nature to which all its truly great developments in all nations are alike essentially and closely related’. [W. E. Gladstone], ‘Tennyson’s Poems’, <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 106 (Oct. 1859), 454–485 at 468.</p>
