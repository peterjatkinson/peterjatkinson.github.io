    <h1>CHAPTER 2</h1>
    <h1>Elgar and Wagnerian Community</h1>
    <p class="first-para-section dropcap">While Edward Elgar’s debt to Wagner has long been acknowledged, and his formative experiences of Wagner’s works have been extensively documented,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref1" href='#_ftn1'>[1]</a> in-depth scholarly studies of the relationship between the two composers are less common. Byron Adams has provided one of the most insightful examinations of Elgar’s Wagnerism, exploring the relationship between his mature oratorios – particularly <em>The Dream of Gerontius</em> (1900) and <em>The Apostles</em> (1903) – and the <em>fin-de-siècle</em> decadence associated with Oscar Wilde, Wagner and Wagnerism.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref2" href='#_ftn2'>[2]</a> Adams observes that this decadent aspect of Wagnerism stems predominantly from <em>Parsifal</em>, which, he argues, shares with <em>Gerontius</em> and <em>The Apostles</em> an atmosphere of ‘erotic religiosity’ and a ‘Wagnerian dialectic of shame and grace’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref3" href='#_ftn3'>[3]</a> Patrick McCreless’s study of Elgar’s Wagnerism focusses on the purely musical similarities between the two composers’ works.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref4" href='#_ftn4'>[4]</a> He examines Elgar’s use of chromaticism by employing analytical methods (‘chromatic theory’) that have often been used for, if not originally developed for, the analysis of Wagner’s music, and thus demonstrates the ways in which Elgar’s music is founded on Wagnerian compositional principles.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref5" href='#_ftn5'>[5]</a> Aidan Thomson has explored the influence of <em>Parsifal</em> on Elgar, highlighting the composer’s adoption of a Wagnerian metaphor of chivalry in his First Symphony (1908) and <em>Falstaff</em> (1913).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref6" href='#_ftn6'>[6]</a> Thomson concludes that Elgar was ‘the leading successor’ to a ‘Wagnerian knightly tradition’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref7" href='#_ftn7'>[7]</a> Three themes dominate these writings: intertextual allusion,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref8" href='#_ftn8'>[8]</a> chromatic harmony and the influence of <em>Parsifal</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref9" href='#_ftn9'>[9]</a></p>
    <p>The focus on chromaticism and the influence of <em>Parsifal</em> in existing studies of Elgar’s Wagnerism reflects the fact that these elements, along with his leitmotivic technique,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref10" href='#_ftn10'>[10]</a> are the most conspicuous Wagnerian influences found in his works. But this emphasis has overshadowed another strand of Elgar’s Wagnerism, one concerned not with decadence but with the idea of community; not with chromaticism but with diatonic music; not with the Ab/D keys associated with <em>Parsifal</em> but with the C/Eb keys associated with <em>Die Meistersinger</em>;&#8288;<a id="_ftnref11" href='#_ftn11'>[11]</a> and, among Elgar’s oratorios, it is associated with <em>The Kingdom</em> (1906) rather than <em>The Apostles</em>. After a consideration of Elgar’s Wagnerian associative use of certain keys and tonal pairings, this chapter considers some of the formative influences on Elgar’s conception of community, notably his holidays in Bavaria in the 1890s, and then situates both Elgar’s and Wagner’s notions of an ideal community in a wider political context. Finally, I demonstrate how both the musical aspects of Elgar’s Wagnerism and his Wagnerian ideas about community converged in a number of his choral and orchestral works composed and performed during the two decades before and after 1900, focussing on <em>Caractacus</em> (1898), <em>Cockaigne</em> (1901) and <em>The Kingdom</em>.</p>
    
    <h2>2.1 Associative Tonality and Tonal Pairing</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">Crucial to the subsequent examination of Elgar’s works will be two music-theoretical ideas, stemming from the work of Robert Bailey. The first of these, known as ‘associative tonality’, involves the consistent use of a specific key in combination with a particular character, object, dramatic theme, or idea within a work.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref12" href='#_ftn12'>[12]</a> The second, ‘tonal pairing’ or ‘double-tonic complex’, refers, according to Harald Krebs’s definition of the term, to ‘situations where two keys simultaneously occupy the highest position in a tonal hierarchy’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref13" href='#_ftn13'>[13]</a> Neither of these ideas is new to Elgar scholarship, as evidenced by the work of Patrick McCreless and J. P. E. Harper-Scott.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref14" href='#_ftn14'>[14]</a> Two tonal pairings are of particular importance in Elgar’s oeuvre: the C/Eb complex and the Ab/D complex. The source of the latter, which is used in Elgar’s First Symphony and to a certain degree in <em>The Apostles</em>, has been identified by musicologists as <em>Parsifal</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref15" href='#_ftn15'>[15]</a> I suggest that Elgar’s use of the C/Eb keys in such works as <em>Caractacus</em>, <em>Cockaigne</em> and <em>The Kingdom</em> is due to the influence of the overture to <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, in which both keys are prominent.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref16" href='#_ftn16'>[16]</a></p>
    <p>What I will here describe as ‘intertextual associative tonality’ has effectively been summed up by Robert Gauldin when he writes that beyond associative key relationships in a single drama, ‘there exists an interesting subset of tonal centers that are linked by more <em>general</em> associations—connections that transcend the tonal schemes of individual works’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref17" href='#_ftn17'>[17]</a> To this definition, it should be added that these connections not only transcend the boundaries of the individual works of one composer but link compositions of multiple composers. The concept of key associations was not a new one in the late nineteenth century,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref18" href='#_ftn18'>[18]</a> and it would be simplistic to suggest that Elgar’s use of associative keys was entirely based on Wagner’s.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref19" href='#_ftn19'>[19]</a> Nonetheless, the German composer’s status as ‘probably the most influential figure in the evolution of nineteenth-century tonality’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref20" href='#_ftn20'>[20]</a> as well as Elgar’s known admiration for his music, suggests that Wagner’s use of associative tonality could have had a particularly strong influence on Elgar’s own.</p>
    <p>Elgar’s use of the key of Ab, for instance, reveals in a number of his works a debt to Wagner. Gauldin observes that Wagner consistently associated this key with love, both ‘spiritual’ and ‘sensual’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref21" href='#_ftn21'>[21]</a> while Ulrike Kienzle has noted that Ab has long been considered the ‘the key of the mystical’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref22" href='#_ftn22'>[22]</a> If these two associations are fused together to form ‘mystical love’, we have a term that quite accurately describes parts of the atmosphere of <em>Parsifal</em> as well as certain moments of Elgar’s works that use the same key. With regard to the use of Ab major in Elgar’s <em>The Apostles</em> and First Symphony, for instance, the connection to <em>Parsifal</em> and love is especially clear because of the prominence of the tritone-related key of D major,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref23" href='#_ftn23'>[23]</a> musical allusions,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref24" href='#_ftn24'>[24]</a> and paratextual links between all three works.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref25" href='#_ftn25'>[25]</a> </p>
    <p>      While Elgar’s Parsifalian use of the key of Ab and its tonal pairing with D is associated with love and mystical qualities, the other important tonal pairing in Elgar’s works, that of C/Eb, is frequently connected to a notion of earthly community and fellowship. Harper-Scott observes that the pairing of C/Eb in Elgar’s works goes back at least to Part II of <em>The Dream of Gerontius</em>, and it is also present in <em>Falstaff</em> and the Second Symphony,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref26" href='#_ftn26'>[26]</a> in which ‘the keys are used […] in a combative manner, each vying for position’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref27" href='#_ftn27'>[27]</a> Although these works are important instances of the C/Eb complex, it is primarily in Elgar’s concert overture <em>Cockaigne</em>, the oratorio <em>The Kingdom</em> and the final pages of <em>Caractacus</em>, where the combination of these two keys is found in conjunction with ideas of community and fellowship. In fact, the key of C major is associated with some form of community from early on in Elgar’s compositional output,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref28" href='#_ftn28'>[28]</a> with Eb major, when combined with C major, later acquiring the same association. It is proposed here, then, that tonal pairings can also be associative and that this ‘associative tonal pairing’ can transcend the boundaries between works and composers (‘intertextual associative tonal pairing’).</p>
    <p>Warren Darcy and Robert Gauldin have each observed that C major has an intertextual associative significance in Wagner’s operas, suggesting that he uses it to ‘represent entrenched society’ or ‘unspoiled innocence, inherent good, and the <em>populace</em>’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref29" href='#_ftn29'>[29]</a> Taking into account Darcy’s and Gauldin’s explanations of Wagner’s associative use of C major, one might say more broadly that C major consistently represents a group of people, large or small (not necessarily the entire ‘populace’), united by shared values and a common will. In short, C major is associated in Wagner’s works with community, and often with an ideal community.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref30" href='#_ftn30'>[30]</a> Related to Wagner’s use of C major to represent society or community, is, Darcy points out, a ‘common thread’ in Wagner’s works – the ‘conflict between the individual and society’:</p>
    <blockquote>Usually the individual is an outsider who represents a certain threat to the established social order: the Dutchman in Daland’s house, Tannhäuser at the Wartburg, Lohengrin in tenth-century Antwerp, Siegfried at the court of the Gibichungs, and Parsifal in the Hall of the Grail. […] Generally the conflict is not so much resolved as terminated in one of two ways: either the individual transcends the social world (as do the Dutchman, Tannhäuser, Siegfried, and Brünnhilde), or he merges with and becomes a part of it (as does Parsifal). The <em>Tristan/Meistersinger</em> dichotomy neatly illustrates this: in <em>Tristan</em>, the lovers transcend the phenomenal world by surrendering their individuality and merging with each other and the universe; in <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, the main characters surrender their individuality in order to merge with a newly reconstituted society.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref31" href='#_ftn31'>[31]</a></blockquote>
    <p>This theme of the community versus the individual(s) is also present in Elgar’s works, and is often found in conjunction with the associative use of C major. As with Elgar’s use of associative tonality and tonal pairing, the prominence of this theme could also be considered a result of Wagner’s influence. To understand this aspect of Wagner’s impact on Elgar, it is first necessary to consider what these two composers actually understood by the concept of an ideal community. </p>
    
    <h2>2.2 Elgar, Wagner and the Notion of Community</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">During the 1890s Elgar and his wife spent five summers holidaying in Bavaria, where they witnessed a number of aspects of Bavarian society that might have shaped Elgar’s ideas about community and consequently his portrayal of communities in his musical works.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref32" href='#_ftn32'>[32]</a> Having only been to Germany once prior to 1892,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref33" href='#_ftn33'>[33]</a> Elgar’s view of Germany, and especially Bavaria, would have been coloured by his acquaintance with <em>Die Meistersinger</em> and by his favourite book of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, <em>Hyperion</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref34" href='#_ftn34'>[34]</a> Longfellow’s semi-autobiographical book tells of a young American man, Paul Flemming, as he travels through Bavaria in the early nineteenth century and falls in love. Elgar once described <em>Hyperion</em> to Hans Richter as the book from which he received his ‘first idea of the great German nations’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref35" href='#_ftn35'>[35]</a> <em>Die Meistersinger</em> is set in the Bavarian city of Nuremberg, and its depiction of an ideal community united by its ‘holy German art’ undoubtedly influenced Elgar’s perception of that ‘romantic region’ (as he described it) when he was there.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref36" href='#_ftn36'>[36]</a></p>
    <p>      Above all, Elgar’s desire to go to Germany was encouraged by the opportunity of seeing Wagner productions, especially as <em>Parsifal</em> was not performed outside of Bayreuth at the time.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref37" href='#_ftn37'>[37]</a> Except for <em>Das Liebesverbot</em>, <em>Rienzi</em> and <em>Lohengrin</em>, Elgar saw every one of Wagner’s operas during his German holidays in the 1890s, many of them on multiple occasions. Information about the Elgars’ experiences in Bavaria can be gathered from various sources: the daily diary entries written by Alice Elgar (with occasional entries from Edward); separate holiday notebooks made by Elgar during the 1893, 1894 and 1895 holidays;&#8288;<a id="_ftnref38" href='#_ftn38'>[38]</a> letters and postcards they sent to friends and family during their trips; and an essay Elgar wrote about part of the 1893 holiday.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref39" href='#_ftn39'>[39]</a> In addition to a large number of comments about the picturesque natural surroundings of Bavaria, a substantial amount of the notes that the Elgars made during their holidays refer to various aspects of community in the region, particularly in relation to its festival culture, religious activities and peasant life.</p>
    <p>During almost all of their 1890s holidays, the Elgars witnessed elements of German festival culture. Alice recorded seeing Cologne (in 1893), Oberammergau (1894) and Würzburg (1895) ‘beflagged’ for festivals and celebrations.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref40" href='#_ftn40'>[40]</a> Elgar also noted the beginning of ‘festivities’ in Garmisch at the end of August 1895,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref41" href='#_ftn41'>[41]</a> and Alice’s diary entry for 22 August 1897 recorded her husband going to some kind of ‘Feste’ in Partenkirchen.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref42" href='#_ftn42'>[42]</a> Elgar would surely have viewed these festivities through the lens of <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, which culminates with a ‘beflagged’ celebration of Nuremberg’s ideal community on the ‘Festwiese’ (Festival Meadow) next to the river Pegnitz. As Arthur Groos has explained, although <em>Die Meistersinger</em> is set in the sixteenth century, much of what occurs in the final scene is ‘more historicist than historical’ and it incorporates ‘the basic elements of nineteenth-century German festival culture’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref43" href='#_ftn43'>[43]</a> Stephanie McClatchie has also noted that the end of <em>Die Meistersinger</em> ‘draws on the “staging of the <em>Volk</em>” characteristic of nineteenth-century public festivals’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref44" href='#_ftn44'>[44]</a> Both Groos and McClatchie observe that the culminating scene of <em>Die Meistersinger</em> and the nineteenth-century festivals that inspired it illustrate a shift of emphasis away from the ‘enlightened individual’, or ‘aristocratic ruler’, towards a focus on the community as a whole instead.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref45" href='#_ftn45'>[45]</a> Elgar’s first-hand experience of German festival culture at least reaffirmed some things he had already seen in <em>Die Meistersinger</em>: a community united by mass celebrations of culture and the triumph of the communal will over that of the individual. The influence of this Bavarian festival culture can be discerned in at least three of Elgar’s works: <em>The Banner of St. George</em>, <em>Caractacus</em> and, to a lesser extent, <em>King Olaf</em>, all of which culminate with what is effectively a community’s celebration of itself.</p>
    <p>      Appearing even more frequently than references to festival culture in the records of the Elgars’ Bavarian holidays are remarks detailing visits to churches. Elgar’s interest in churches was in part because of his fascination with the music he heard in them,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref46" href='#_ftn46'>[46]</a> but the fact that Bavaria was a Catholic region was probably the main reason for Elgar’s interest in the religious activities in the area. In a letter to Hubert Leicester he described Bavaria as ‘a Catholic country’ and in his short essay on part of the 1893 holiday, Elgar recounted arriving in Oberammergau where he observed ‘a small crowd of villagers &amp; the Catholic inhabitants’ of a nearby house.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref47" href='#_ftn47'>[47]</a> The Bavarians’ religion, specifically their Catholic faith, was another element that united their community, just as it was a central part of Elgar’s own childhood community in Worcester.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref48" href='#_ftn48'>[48]</a></p>
    <p>What seems to have fascinated Elgar most of all during these German holidays, however, was the communal life of the Bavarian peasants.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref49" href='#_ftn49'>[49]</a> In his notebook from the 1893 holiday Elgar described a party he attended in Hammersbach at which ‘peasants played &amp; sang in parts fresh from the hay cutting’, and he sketched the traditional dress worn by the Bavarian men and women.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref50" href='#_ftn50'>[50]</a> On a postcard Elgar sent to his mother during the same trip, he described the peasants at the church service he and Alice attended on the morning of 15 August: ‘Peasants all into Mass this mg. in best clothes &amp; many carrying in large armfuls of herbs &amp; flowers to be blessed so strange &amp; pretty’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref51" href='#_ftn51'>[51]</a> Elgar noted various other aspects of the peasants’ daily life and work during his German holidays, such as the haymakers who remained on the hillsides all night,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref52" href='#_ftn52'>[52]</a> ‘poor people’ fetching water from fountains in the streets, and firewood being left in the streets to be cut up and taken away.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref53" href='#_ftn53'>[53]</a> Elgar observed that the Bavarians were ‘such nice, friendly people &amp; so polite’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref54" href='#_ftn54'>[54]</a> and in his programme note for the six choral part-songs, <em>Scenes from the Bavarian Highlands</em> (composed after the 1894 holiday), Elgar referred to them as ‘a noble and simple people’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref55" href='#_ftn55'>[55]</a> Elgar also remarked that in the ‘delightful land [of Bavaria] much wealth does not seem necessary to give great happiness’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref56" href='#_ftn56'>[56]</a> suggesting, perhaps, that he was again filtering his perception of Bavaria through <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, in which any kind of pecuniary exchange is conspicuously absent.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref57" href='#_ftn57'>[57]</a></p>
    <p>      The kind of community that Elgar felt he had seen in Bavaria – a romanticised, ideal community similar to that depicted in <em>Die Meistersinger</em> – might be effectively summed up by an appropriately German word: <em>Gemeinschaft</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref58" href='#_ftn58'>[58]</a> The concept of <em>Gemeinschaft</em> as a type of social organisation distinct from <em>Gesellschaft</em> derives largely from Ferdinand Tönnies’s classic text, <em>Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft</em> (usually translated as ‘Community and Society’), first published in 1887.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref59" href='#_ftn59'>[59]</a> <em>Gemeinschaft</em>, according to Tönnies, is a natural form of social organisation, based on familial relations and fellowship, and linked to tradition and rural life. <em>Gesellschaft</em>, by contrast, is a mechanical, ‘transient and superficial’ structure in which individuals act mainly out of self-interest, and it is linked to modernity and urban living.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref60" href='#_ftn60'>[60]</a> In Tönnies’s theory of <em>Gemeinschaft</em>, religion and art should be ‘the most important matters in the <em>whole</em> of civic life’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref61" href='#_ftn61'>[61]</a></p>
    <p>      Many of Tönnies’s ideas about ideal community were shared by Wagner and Elgar, but it should be noted that although the original subtitle of Tönnies’s book was ‘Treatise on Communism and Socialism as Empirical Patterns of Culture’ (‘<em>Abhandlung des Communismus und des Socialismus als empirischer Culturformen</em>’), the kind of <em>Gemeinschaft</em> envisaged by Elgar and (post-revolutionary) Wagner was a distinctly conservative one. Anastasia Siopsi has compared the development of Wagner’s notion of community – from his revolutionary writings to his post-1860s prose works – with that of the early Romantics.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref62" href='#_ftn62'>[62]</a> Siopsi argues that in the later writings of Wagner and the early Romantics there is a turn towards conservative values as they began to lose faith in the ‘ability of the people to reach an ideal state of community by themselves’, and thus accepted the authority of the state as ‘the only available means’ to defend communitarian values against an opposing ideology of individualism.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref63" href='#_ftn63'>[63]</a> Both came to contrast a liberal, materialistic and individualistic society – the <em>Gesellschaft</em> of their present – with an idealistic <em>Gemeinschaft</em> rooted in the traditions of the past but due to (re)materialise at some point in a utopian future. For Wagner and the early romantics, communal art or religion were considered essential for guiding humanity towards this ideal. As Siopsi observes, art and religion had ‘interchanging roles’ for Wagner, as both could express fundamental truths and ‘ideas which were distinctively opposed to materialism’, individualism and <em>Gesellschaft</em> values.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref64" href='#_ftn64'>[64]</a></p>
    <p>The communities in <em>Die Meistersinger</em> and <em>Parsifal</em> epitomise Wagner’s notion of an ideal conservative community (<em>Gemeinschaft</em>) united by art or religion. Both art and religion are present in the earlier work, while religion is fundamental to the Grail community in the later work.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref65" href='#_ftn65'>[65]</a> Thomas Rohkrämer, discussing German conservatism in the nineteenth century, effectively sums up the kind of community that conservatives like Wagner idealised:</p>
    <blockquote>Above all, conservatives contrasted an allegedly cold liberal society of individuals, where communal action is only driven by material self-interest, with their ideal of a closely knit, warm community united by a single communal faith.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref66" href='#_ftn66'>[66]</a></blockquote>
    <p class="first-para-section">This equally applies to Elgar who was a conservative with anti-liberal (though not anti-Semitic) views and who supported and had close ties with the monarchy.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref67" href='#_ftn67'>[67]</a> His conservatism was undoubtedly encouraged by his marriage, in 1889, to a woman who was higher up the social class ladder than he was.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref68" href='#_ftn68'>[68]</a> Gerald Cumberland (Charles Kenyon), who visited the Elgars in December 1905, shortly before the 1906 general election, recalled that Alice had some ‘rather violent political prejudices’, considering ‘Radicals’ and Nonconformists to be ‘the Unspeakable People’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref69" href='#_ftn69'>[69]</a> Edward, too, sometimes exhibited his own strong political prejudices, as when he resigned his membership of the Athenaeum due to the election of Ramsey MacDonald as a member,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref70" href='#_ftn70'>[70]</a> and when he claimed to be considering emigration to America after the Liberals’ landslide election victory in 1906.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref71" href='#_ftn71'>[71]</a> In the same year, Elgar even wrote to Hubert Leicester expressing an interest in standing for parliament himself, as a Unionist candidate.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref72" href='#_ftn72'>[72]</a></p>
    <p>      Brian Trowell and Byron Adams have considered the influence of John Ruskin’s left-wing ideas on Elgar,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref73" href='#_ftn73'>[73]</a> with Adams noting that Elgar’s call for concert venues in every town ‘capable of accommodating a large <em>sixpenny audience</em>’ seems to indicate Elgar’s ‘internalization’ of Ruskinian ideas.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref74" href='#_ftn74'>[74]</a> However, Elgar’s suggestion is perfectly in keeping with a conservative vision of community in which art is communal and free for all. This was something Wagner also supported from the time of his early revolutionary writings. In ‘Art and Revolution’ (1849), for example, he wrote that ‘the public must have <em>unbought</em> admission to the theatrical representations’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref75" href='#_ftn75'>[75]</a> Elgar’s sympathetic feelings towards those in the lower echelons of society coheres with a ‘distinctive brand of Conservative Collectivism’ that emerged in British politics in the period 1880–1914.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref76" href='#_ftn76'>[76]</a> For collectivist conservatives community was important and those higher up in the social order had a duty to look after the working classes in a paternal manner, thus forming a community based on traditional familial relationships as in <em>Gemeinschaft</em> social relations.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref77" href='#_ftn77'>[77]</a></p>
    <p>The similarities between Wagner’s and Elgar’s notions of an ideal community are evident not only in their ideas about community on a large scale (in relation to entire nations) but also in their ideas about a small community of artists. Two of Elgar’s speeches illustrate this. In his inaugural lecture as the Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham in 1905, Elgar proclaimed the following:</p>
    <blockquote>One thing is <em>not</em> indefinite and that is my goodwill and I will say love of my fellow musicians. I hold very definite views as to our art, but I do not intend to use my position here in any other way than for the great, broad, open and let us say, peaceful advancement of the best. I therefore cordially invite the co-operation of all Birmingham musicians to this end; let us sink small differences and hold in view the good of our beloved art only.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref78" href='#_ftn78'>[78]</a></blockquote>
    <p class="first-para-section">Two years later, at a dinner hosted by the Leeds Association of Professional Musicians, Elgar made some very similar remarks, as reported by the <em>Manchester Guardian</em>:</p>
    <blockquote>Sir Edward Elgar […] said that a society of professional musicians working harmoniously together was an example, and one of the finest things that could happen. […] he liked to talk over his thoughts with his fellow-composers and musicians. He thought there was nothing for a musician like mixing with his fellows. The artist’s life was helped considerably by such mixing.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref79" href='#_ftn79'>[79]</a></blockquote>
    <p class="first-para-section">This community of artists that Elgar encouraged invites comparison with the community of the Mastersingers in <em>Die Meistersinger</em>. Elgar’s reference to ‘our beloved art’ echoes the ‘holy German Art’ exalted by the <em>Volk</em> on the <em>Festwiese</em> at the end of <em>Die Meistersinger</em>. Moreover, his remark about sinking small differences for the sake of this art is in the spirit of Hans Sachs’s selflessness in pursuit of a greater communal cause.</p>
    <p>      Elgar’s speeches in Birmingham and Leeds perhaps also show traces of his reading of Wagner’s prose works, which Elgar obtained in 1902. The extent to which Elgar delved into the <em>Prose Works</em> is unknown,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref80" href='#_ftn80'>[80]</a> but his remarks about cooperation between ‘fellow’ composers and musicians is somewhat reminiscent of the ‘fellowship of all the artists’ or ‘artistic fellowship’ discussed by Wagner in <em>The Art-Work of the Future</em> (1849).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref81" href='#_ftn81'>[81]</a> Even before Elgar received his volumes of Wagner’s <em>Prose Works</em>, he would have seen in an analysis of <em>Tristan</em> that he acquired in 1892 a reference to Wagner’s notion of a ‘<em>fellowship of artists</em>’, and in a <em>Meistersinger</em> analysis a motif in the overture labelled as ‘<em>fellowship in Art</em>’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref82" href='#_ftn82'>[82]</a> Although Elgar did not envisage an artistic fellowship creating some kind of ‘associate’ artwork in the future, in the way that Wagner did, the concept of fellowship was clearly an important one for him. It effectively describes the feeling and the relationship that exists between individuals in the conservative <em>Gemeinschaft</em> idealised by Elgar and Wagner. The word fellowship also has Christian connotations, so Elgar may have associated it with religious community in particular.</p>
    <p>Elgar’s ideas about community and fellowship were shaped by a wide range of influences beyond Wagner.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref83" href='#_ftn83'>[83]</a> Nonetheless, Elgar’s use of certain associative tonalities and tonal pairings, as well as frequent Wagnerian musical and textual allusions, in conjunction with communal aspects of his work all point to the overriding importance of Wagner. To summarise, there are essentially two types of Wagnerian ideal community that are relevant to Elgar’s works. Both types are anti-liberal, anti-materialist, anti-individualist, conservative <em>Gemeinschaften</em> in which art and/or religion plays a fundamental role in shaping the community’s identity and maintaining its stability. The difference between the two types is size. On the one hand there is the <em>Volk</em> – the entire population of the city of Nuremberg in <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, for example – and on the other there are the smaller, exclusive communities based on brotherly love, like those of the Mastersingers and the Grail Knights. Both kinds of community re-emerge in Elgar’s works – the first kind is exemplified by <em>Cockaigne</em> and <em>Caractacus</em>, and the other by <em>The Kingdom</em> – and these depictions of community often display elements of the Bavarian communal culture that Elgar witnessed in the 1890s.</p>
    
    <h2>2.3 Wagnerian Community, Intertextual Associative Tonality and Tonal Pairing in Elgar’s Works</h2>
    <h3>2.3.1 The Black Knight and Scenes from the Bavarian Highlands</h3>
    <p class="first-para-section">The Wagnerian theme of the community versus the individual is apparent in Elgar’s earliest major choral work, <em>The Black Knight</em> (1893).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref84" href='#_ftn84'>[84]</a> The start of the work’s second scene (a merry gathering of a community at a jousting competition; Ex. 2.1) is possibly the first moment in any of Elgar’s works where he links community with C major, and, moreover, demonstrates that the source of this association is <em>Die Meistersinger</em>: the first eight bars of this scene are strikingly similar (in terms of their key, orchestration, ascending motion and jovial character) to parts of the overture to <em>Die Meistersinger</em>. The six choral songs that form the composition most directly inspired by Elgar’s German holidays in the 1890s, <em>Scenes from the Bavarian Highlands</em> (1894–5), are also concerned with communal themes. The fourth song of the set, ‘Aspiration’, which depicts a community united by its Christian faith praying to God for guidance, employs the key of C major. Here, too, Elgar may have had <em>Die Meistersinger</em> in mind, especially the Nurembergian community singing a chorale in C major in a Bavarian church at the start of Act I.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref85" href='#_ftn85'>[85]</a></p>

    <h3>2.3.2 Scenes from the Saga of King Olaf</h3>
    <p class="first-para-section">Elgar’s choral work <em>Scenes from the Saga of King Olaf</em> (1896) is, in terms of its subject matter, one of his most Wagnerian works, coming closest to the kind of mythology that inspired Wagner’s <em>Ring</em> cycle.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref86" href='#_ftn86'>[86]</a> The work’s libretto is based on Longfellow’s ‘The Saga of King Olaf’, part of his <em>Tales of a Wayside Inn</em> (1863), but was significantly revised by Elgar’s collaborator, Harry A. Acworth.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref87" href='#_ftn87'>[87]</a> As in previous and subsequent works the themes of (Christian) community, as well as individual concerns and desires, are prominent. All three of the main female characters in the work, Gudrun, Sigrid and Thyri, are portrayed as vengeful individuals whose selfish motives lead to problems either for themselves, for other individuals or for whole communities. Even King Olaf, who was made to appear in a more favourable light in Elgar and Acworth’s version than in Longfellow’s original poem,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref88" href='#_ftn88'>[88]</a> is depicted as a reckless and violent individual whose actions lead to the suffering of members of his and other communities, and ultimately to his own demise.</p>
    <p>Two of the longest sections of <em>King Olaf</em>, the ‘Conversion’ scene and the Epilogue, are linked to the Christian community. As the title of the first of these sections suggests, after having witnessed Ironbeard’s death and King Olaf’s shattering of the image of Thor, the ‘men of Drontheim’ are overwhelmed by the power of Christ and embrace Christianity.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref89" href='#_ftn89'>[89]</a> This scene concludes in the key of C major, affirming the newly-formed peaceful Christian community. In fact, the associative meaning of C major is already established in the recitative that precedes the ‘Conversion’ scene, where a C major chord is sounded at the word ‘peace’ (‘Winning to the God of <em>peace</em>’). Similarly, in the middle of the Conversion scene, just before Ironbeard’s death, a cadence in C major occurs just as Ironbeard sings ‘perchance it may be, / That thy Peace-God shall rule o’er the Norlander free’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref90" href='#_ftn90'>[90]</a></p>
    <p>While the ‘Conversion’ scene depicts the inception of a tenth-century Christian community, the Epilogue alludes to a future community that exists outside of the time of cantata itself. King Olaf’s evangelising mission will continue, explain the chorus and soli, no longer with violence and war, but rather with the true Christian weapons of peace and love. There is a parallel between <em>King Olaf</em>’s Epilogue and the final scene of <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, in which Sachs’s address to the <em>Volk</em> and the final chorus step outside the story of the opera itself and address Wagner’s nineteenth-century audience. Arthur Groos, discussing what he terms ‘typological’ and ‘proleptic’ communities in <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, writes that there is ‘not only a sense of historical community’ in the opera but also a ‘prescription for the future German nation’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref91" href='#_ftn91'>[91]</a> While the Epilogue of <em>King Olaf</em> does not so clearly address Elgar’s late nineteenth-century audience, Elgar and Acworth provide both a prophecy and a prescription for a future peaceful Christian community and, in turn, a regenerated Britain.</p>
    <p>Groos observes that the conclusion of <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, ‘both textually and musically’, presents ‘a nexus of ambiguities that await a resolution outside the opera’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref92" href='#_ftn92'>[92]</a> Musically, the end of <em>King Olaf</em> is also ambiguous, with the top voice coming to rest on 5/G<span class="comment"> (Should be scale degree on 5)</span> and the final chord heard in the orchestra missing the third (Ex. 2.2). This inconclusive musical ending reflects the broader message of the Epilogue: the work of the Christian evangelising mission is not over; as with <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, the real conclusion of <em>King Olaf</em> is to be found in the future. Elgar does not employ C major in the Epilogue but the key with which it is paired in many of his later works, Eb major, is present during the Epilogue’s ‘As Torrents in Summer’ chorus. Although these two keys do not form a tonal pairing in <em>King Olaf</em>, the use of each key in sections of the work that relate to Christian community anticipates the pairing of these keys in <em>The Kingdom</em>. The connection between this oratorio and the ‘Torrents’ chorus is established not only by the key of Eb but also by the music accompanying the words ‘suddenly rise’ and ‘they that behold it’, which seems to have served as the basis of the ‘New Faith’ motif found in <em>The Kingdom</em> (see Exx. 2.3 and 2.4).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref93" href='#_ftn93'>[93]</a></p>

    <h3>2.3.3 Caractacus</h3>
    <p class="first-para-section">Michael Pope has observed that ‘the Epilogue standing outside the action’ is ‘a structural feature’ found not just in <em>King Olaf</em> but also in <em>The Banner of St. George</em> and <em>Caractacus</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref94" href='#_ftn94'>[94]</a> While the use of such an epilogue in all three works shows the influence of <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, this connection is especially pertinent to <em>Caractacus</em>, the final nationalistic chorus of which has been described by Robin Holloway as the ‘English recreation of the closing <em>Meistersinger</em> chorus’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref95" href='#_ftn95'>[95]</a> Not only are there strong textual similarities between the two choruses (and Sachs’s address) – ‘Britons, alert!’ and ‘Habt Acht!’; ‘the empire of the Roman is crumbled into clay’ and ‘zerging’ in Dunst das heil’ge röm’sche Reich’&#8288;<a id="_ftnref96" href='#_ftn96'>96[]</a> – <em>Caractacus</em> is also Elgar’s first composition in which the pairing of C and Eb comes to the fore (C major and minor to begin with but especially C major in the final scene). This indicates a further link to <em>Die</em> <em>Meistersinger</em> – to the overture, in which both keys are used, though in a more traditional manner rather than as a tonal pairing. Moreover, the final chorus represents another proleptic community, like that which Arthur Groos discusses in relation to <em>Die Meistersinger</em>.</p>
    <p>In contrast with <em>King Olaf</em>, it is the individuals that suffer at the hands of the community in <em>Caractacus</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref97" href='#_ftn97'>[97]</a> The ultimate message of the work, however, as conveyed by the final chorus, is a celebration of community, though in this instance without any explicit mention of art or religion, the unifying function of which is achieved instead by a fervent nationalism and lauding of the British Empire.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref98" href='#_ftn98'>[98]</a> There is a question as to whether the libretto and the message conveyed by the work reflect Elgar’s intention or just that of his librettist, Acworth. Although McGuire argues that Acworth’s ‘enthusiasm for the British empire might have been ultimately greater than Elgar’s’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref99" href='#_ftn99'>[99]</a> the composer’s defence of <em>Caractacus</em> – ‘England for the English is all I say—hands off! there’s nothing apologetic about me’&#8288;<a id="_ftnref100" href='#_ftn100'>100[]</a> – suggests that he, too, approved of the nationalist sentiment of the final chorus. It was not just the imperialist aspect of Acworth’s words that appealed to Elgar, but the sense of community that the project of the Empire was ultimately supposed to entail. After all, the final words of <em>Caractacus</em> speak of a sense of brotherhood: ‘The nations all shall stand / And hymn the praise of Britain, / Like brothers, hand in hand’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref101" href='#_ftn101'>[101]</a></p>
    <p>The reference to ‘opposing cohorts’ in the final chorus highlights the fact that Elgar’s ideal community must be defined, in part, by whom and what it is not; for there to be insiders there must be outsiders. In <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, for example, Beckmesser is excluded from Nuremberg’s community because of his ‘greed, conventionality, lack of love, an inability to understand true art, and an insistence on rules and regulations’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref102" href='#_ftn102'>[102]</a> His exclusion, writes Lutz Koepnick, serves ‘to reinforce the boundaries of that which is familiar and communal’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref103" href='#_ftn103'>[103]</a> In his final address to the <em>Volk</em> (to the people on the stage and in the audience) in <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, Hans Sachs speaks of other outsiders that pose an even greater threat to the community than the individual Beckmesser. He issues a warning about ‘false, foreign rule’ and the ‘evil tricks’ that threaten them. As demonstrated by the final chorus of <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, this fear of outsiders serves to reinforce the bonds of a community. This is something Ferdinand Tönnies recognised in his theory of <em>Gemeinschaft</em>: ‘The more this group is threatened from the outside, the more bonding together will be likely to occur, because circumstances impose the need to stick together to fight and act collectively.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref104" href='#_ftn104'>[104]</a></p>
    <p>As in Elgar’s later work, <em>Falstaff</em>, each side of the C/Eb pairing in <em>Caractacus</em> has a specific association with an element of the text: for the most part, C (major and minor) is associated with Rome and Romans and Eb major is linked with Britain and Britons.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref105" href='#_ftn105'>[105]</a> These associations are established early on in the cantata. Immediately after the chorus’s first entry in Scene I (‘Watchmen, alert!’), they sing ‘the Roman hosts Have girdled in our British coasts’ (Ex. 2.5), with a C minor chord sung and played by the orchestra on the word ‘Roman’ and the pitch Eb sung on the first syllable of ‘British’, accompanied by an Eb major chord in the orchestra. Furthermore, the motif in the orchestra accompanying the word British is consistently linked to Britain throughout the work.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref106" href='#_ftn106'>[106]</a> In fact, Elgar specifically labelled the music at fig. 4:5 as the ‘Roman theme’ and the music two bars later as ‘Britain!’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref107" href='#_ftn107'>[107]</a> Considering, then, that much of <em>Caractacus</em> is concerned with the conflict between Britain and Rome, it follows that their two associative tonalities also seem to be ‘vying for position’ in certain parts of the work. Anticipating <em>The Kingdom</em>, it is primarily the first and the last scenes of the cantata in which the C/Eb pairing is most prominent. In the first few bars of the opening scene, the repeated semiquavers on the note C, followed by the same repeated semiquavers sounding an Eb, present, in microcosm, the significance of this pairing for the whole work. Scene VI begins with a twelve-bar period in C major based on the ‘Roman theme’. This triumphant march theme (first heard in the parallel minor key in Scene I) also evokes the atmosphere of the overture to <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, especially in the stepwise rising figures in the bass in bars 4 and 10 (Ex. 2.6). </p>
    
    <caption><strong>Example 2.5</strong>  Elgar, <em>Caractacus</em>, scene i, fig. 4:4–8</caption>
    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="/images/placeholder.png" alt="Placeholder">
    </div> 
    
    <p>      Although the final chorus begins in C minor, it is primarily the major modes of C and Eb that predominate here. Eb’s association with Britain is again affirmed by the elided <em>fortississimo</em> cadence in that key at the word ‘Britons’ (shortly after fig. 53), but the distinction between the extramusical associations of these two keys soon collapses in the final chorus. As Holloway points out, the triplets associated with the Roman march theme and consequently the key of C, are brought into the realm of Eb (briefly after fig. 54 but mainly between figs. 60 and 61), ‘thus subsuming ancient pagan Rome […] within modern Britain’ (Ex. 2.7; Elgar labelled this theme ‘Modern Britain’).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref108" href='#_ftn108'>[108]</a> Conversely, the motif associated with Britain and Eb is now heard in the Roman C major (from fig. 57; Ex. 2.8). The meaning of this fusion of previously opposing musical elements is clear: the final chorus speaks of a nineteenth-century Britain and its Empire which is construed as a synthesis of British and Roman characteristics. Therefore, although it is Eb, the key of Britain, in which the work eventually concludes, the C/Eb pairing no longer represents an extramusical conflict in the final chorus. Instead, the two keys represent two parts of a harmonious whole. While each key has its own <em>intra</em>xtextual association throughout most of <em>Caractacus</em>, at the end of the work it is the tonal pairing itself which has an associative significance. And it is an <em>inter</em>textual association of C/Eb with community, acquired not only through the link with the <em>Die Meistersinger</em> but also retrospectively through Elgar’s later works, <em>Cockaigne</em> and <em>The Kingdom</em>.</p>

    <h3>2.3.4 Cockaigne</h3>
    <p class="first-para-section">More than any other work by Elgar, <em>Cockaigne</em> displays intertextual links with <em>Die Meistersinger</em> (especially its overture). As with the depiction of Nuremberg in Wagner’s music drama, the ‘London Town’ of <em>Cockaigne</em> is another portrayal of an ideal community. In a recent article on <em>Cockaigne</em>,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref109" href='#_ftn109'>[109]</a> Aidan Thomson argues against what he refers to as ‘one-nation readings of the overture’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref110" href='#_ftn110'>[110]</a> which describe the work in terms of ‘Romantic, nature-inspired organicism’, and instead interprets the work as a dystopian ‘depiction of an early twentieth-century megalopolis’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref111" href='#_ftn111'>[111]</a> According to Thomson, <em>Cockaigne</em> should be considered in terms of a rural-urban dichotomy, ‘a singular, romanticized countryside versus a plural, modernist city’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref112" href='#_ftn112'>[112]</a> On the contrary, it is the contention here that <em>Cockaigne</em> illustrates a transferral of <em>Gemeinschaft</em> values of fellowship, traditionally associated with the countryside, from the rural to the urban. The same transferral of rural values to an urban environment underpins the depiction of Nuremberg in <em>Die Meistersinger</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref113" href='#_ftn113'>[113]</a> Thomson notes that the idea that Elgar ‘imposed a ruralist prototype on London’ is implicit in Jerrold Northrop Moore’s reading of <em>Cockaigne</em>, and thus in some ways the present interpretation is not a new one, but it gains weight if the connections with <em>Die Meistersinger</em> are explored more thoroughly than they have been up till now.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref114" href='#_ftn114'>[114]</a></p>
    <p>      The connection between the <em>Cockaigne</em> and <em>Meistersinger</em> overtures has been a recurrent issue in the reception history of the former work ever since its premiere in June 1901. This aspect of the work’s reception seems to have been shaped, in large part, by Joseph Bennett’s programme notes written for the first performance. These notes highlight a similarity between the two pieces: he wrote that the <em>scherzando</em> theme at fig. 7 of <em>Cockaigne</em> (Ex. 2.9) represented the ‘pranks of young London, pert and nimble as the apprentices in “Die Meistersinger”’, and noted that this was a rhythmically diminished version of the earlier theme (Ex. 2.10) that he described as the ‘strong and sincere character of Londoners’&#8288;<a id="_ftnref115" href='#_ftn115'>115[]</a> (hereafter I will refer to these themes as ‘Londoner’ and ‘Young Londoner’ respectively).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref116" href='#_ftn116'>[116]</a> Although not stated explicitly by Bennett, his comparison implies that Elgar emulated Wagner’s technique of representing the younger citizens of his Nuremberg by creating a rhythmically diminished version of the <em>Meistersinger</em> overture’s ‘Meistersinger’ motif. Many reviews of the premiere, later performances, and other comments about the work in general, mentioned this borrowing of Wagner’s procedure of diminution, as well as more general similarities between the two overtures. The <em>Manchester Guardian</em>’s review of the first performance in Manchester is typical:</p>
    <blockquote>If any previously existing overture is to be mentioned in order to indicate the type to which “Cockaigne” belongs, it must obviously be “Meistersinger.” […] that the composer of “Cockaigne” had “Meistersinger” in mind is rendered practically certain by one particular point—the use of a Londoner theme and of the same theme in diminution for the youthful Londoner, in exact analogy with Wagner’s symbols for the Meistersingers and apprentices.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref117" href='#_ftn117'>[117]</a></blockquote>

      <img src="/images/placeholder.png" alt="Placeholder">
    </div> 
    
    <p>Elgar later claimed that the idea of using diminution ‘to mark youth’ came to him first from Léo Delibes’s <em>Sylvia</em>, before he had heard <em>Die Meistersinger</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref118" href='#_ftn118'>[118]</a> While this could be true, the analysis of <em>Die Meistersinger</em> owned by Elgar states explicitly that the theme at the start of the Eb scherzo-like section of Wagner’s overture is a ‘rhythmic diminution’ of the ‘Meistersinger’ motif which is intended to depict the ‘German burgher in its almost childlike happiness’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref119" href='#_ftn119'>[119]</a> It seems highly unlikely that Wagner was not Elgar’s immediate model for the procedure of rhythmic diminution. While <em>Cockaigne</em>’s debt to <em>Die Meistersinger</em> in this respect is well known, it does not seem to have been observed that the music itself of Elgar’s ‘Young Londoner’ theme (and thus also that of the ‘Londoner’ theme), not just the procedure used to create it, alludes to parts of the scherzo section of Wagner’s overture. Specifically, it is the figure of a descending minor third (or, in Wagner, sometimes a major third or perfect fourth) and then a rising semitone, that Elgar appears to have copied from Wagner (see Ex. 2.11). </p>

    <p>Elgar’s use of the community key of C major in <em>Cockaigne</em>,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref120" href='#_ftn120'>[120]</a> along with Eb major as the other principal key of the work also suggests the influence of the <em>Meistersinger</em> overture. This connection is made especially clear by the character of the Eb <em>scherzando</em> sections in each work. Another parallel is the positioning of a motif associated with love (in <em>Die Meistersinger</em>) or a pair of lovers (in <em>Cockaigne</em>) shortly before the <em>scherzando</em> sections in both pieces (and which acts as a second subject in both).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref121" href='#_ftn121'>[121]</a> What Thomson identifies as the second episode of the development section of <em>Cockaigne</em> is usually associated with a scene in a church, suggesting an analogy with the opening of <em>Die Meistersinger</em>’s first act. The presence of the church indicates the importance of the unifying effect of a single communal faith in a conservative <em>Gemeinschaft</em> – something Elgar saw first-hand in Catholic Bavaria. This is demonstrated by the music at the end of the development where the ‘Young Londoner’ and ‘Lovers’ themes are each used in turn in counterpoint with the ‘Church’ theme, illustrating the Church’s ability to bring together people from different parts of the community.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref122" href='#_ftn122'>[122]</a> Elgar was probably using the <em>Meistersinger</em> overture as a model again at this point, specifically the music from bar 158 of Wagner’s overture where his ‘Meistersinger’, ‘Love’ and ‘Banner’ motifs are all heard simultaneously,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref123" href='#_ftn123'>[123]</a> representing the coherence of Nuremberg’s community.</p>
    <p>Elgar’s use of his characteristic expressive marking <em>nobilmente</em> for the ‘Londoner’ theme is significant, not least because <em>Cockaigne</em> was the first orchestral work in which Elgar used this direction.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref124" href='#_ftn124'>[124]</a> Thomson suggests that the citizen represented by the ‘Londoner’ theme might be interpreted as ‘a wealthier, more successful version of the Cockney’ (represented by the ‘Young Londoner’ theme), a capitalist whose nobility is achieved through competitive individualism.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref125" href='#_ftn125'>[125]</a> One might contend, however, that the kind of nobility Elgar had in mind for his Londoner was less to do with wealth and class than a certain set of principles and morals, the nobility of a good member of the community. Elgar claimed that the ‘noble melody’ of the ‘Londoner’ theme first came to him ‘one dark day in the Guildhall’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref126" href='#_ftn126'>[126]</a> but perhaps he had cast his mind back to the ‘noble and simple’ Bavarians whom he had admired and who, he observed, had found great happiness without great wealth. It might seem incongruent to suggest that Elgar’s inspiration for a work about the modern, urban English capital could have come, in part, from a rural Bavarian community, or even a Bavarian peasant community. But the ‘London Town’ of <em>Cockaigne</em> is an imagined London, like the imagined Nuremberg in <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, and, given Elgar’s politics, it seems more likely that Elgar would have wanted to impose on London the characteristics of a romanticised Bavarian <em>Gemeinschaft</em> than the individualistic, liberal <em>Gesellschaft</em> values of a twentieth-century capitalist megalopolis. In any case, the numerous musical parallels between <em>Cockaigne</em> and the <em>Meistersinger</em> overtures support the idea of there being some kind of Bavarian inspiration behind the work. The military band march (from fig. 17 of the score) might also have been inspired by Elgar’s experiences in Bavaria, where he saw at least two military festivals in the 1890s and a marching brass band during a student procession in Heidelberg.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref127" href='#_ftn127'>[127]</a> </p>
    <p>Other aspects of <em>Cockaigne</em>, however, allude to the specific sense of English (or British) community that Elgar wished to convey in the work. In addition to the title and subtitle of the work, there are two other paratextual elements that hint at this English/British dimension of the work.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref128" href='#_ftn128'>[128]</a> First, there is Elgar’s remark to Joseph Bennett that the title of the work ‘calls up to my mind all the good-humour, jollity and something deeper in the way of English good fellowship (as it were) abiding still in our capital’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref129" href='#_ftn129'>[129]</a> As has been noted above, the concept of ‘fellowship’ was of great importance to Elgar, as it represented for him the relationship between members of an ideal community who are united by shared interests rather than divided by the competitive self-interest of individuals. </p>
    <p>While Elgar’s remark about the fellowship abiding in London alludes to the kind of large-scale <em>Gemeinschaft</em> exemplified by the <em>Volk</em> of <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, the dedication on the title page of <em>Cockaigne</em> – ‘to my many friends, the members of British orchestras’ – points to the other, smaller and exclusive kind of Wagnerian community: a community of artists. This dedication should be seen in the light of Elgar’s later comments in his Birmingham and Leeds speeches in which he highlighted the importance of musicians mixing with each other, and also in relation to his remark in a letter to Arthur Benson in June 1906 that ‘the fellowship in choirs among people of good feeling &amp; culture is great’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref130" href='#_ftn130'>[130]</a> The underlying theme in all of this is Elgar’s belief in a type of fellowship found through art that brings people together to form a sense of community. </p>
    <p>      By the time Elgar composed <em>Cockaigne</em>, he had already established the association between the C/Eb pairing and the notion of community in <em>Caractacus</em>. In <em>Cockaigne</em>, however, as in Wagner’s <em>Meistersinger</em> overture, the two keys do not really compete and are used in a traditional way, rather than as a tonal pairing or double-tonic complex. For the most part, there is no threat to C major’s dominance; Eb is used as the key for the secondary-theme zone and in the development, but in the recapitulation the ‘Lovers’, ‘Cockney’ and ‘Military March’ themes all return in C major. On the other hand, Elgar avoids any clearly articulated cadence in C until the very end, which undermines its stability and shows the influence of Wagner’s own technique of evading cadences to increase the musical tension and maximise the desire for resolution. Thomson, pointing out that there is only one perfect authentic cadence in all occurrences of the ‘Londoner’ theme in the work, suggests that this tonal instability reflects the inherent instability of the individual’s position in a dystopian urban society: the theme ‘presupposes a divided society whose members are in perpetual competition with each other’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref131" href='#_ftn131'>[131]</a> I propose instead that the ‘Londoner’ theme’s inability to arrive at a strong cadence until the end indicates that the individual is unable to achieve completeness by him or herself; only as part of the community as a whole is the individual’s identity fully formed.</p>
    <p>The only point in <em>Cockaigne</em> that really suggests Eb major could be on an equal standing with C major is the final climactic statement of the ‘Londoner’ theme in Eb at the end of the work. This sudden shift to Eb in a recapitulation that is otherwise in C major, as well as the equally sudden shift back to C for the final few bars, is unusual and invites interpretation. Thomson reads this ending as representative of a conflict between the individual citizen and the city, or society, as a whole: ‘the ideal citizen (expressed in the heroic key of E-flat major) has ultimately been swallowed up by the sheer power of the city (expressed in C major)’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref132" href='#_ftn132'>[132]</a> While the ending of <em>Cockaigne</em> could indeed be interpreted as a conflict between the individual and the community, the conclusions drawn from such a reading need not be pessimistic. The final triumph of C major, if it is considered the key of (ideal) community, might simply represent the supremacy of the communal will over that of an individual. Viewed in this light, the individual being ‘swallowed up’, or rather subsumed, by the community, is positive. As in Darcy’s reading of <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, there is a surrendering of ‘individuality in order to merge with a newly reconstituted society’. </p>
    
    <h3>2.3.5 The Kingdom</h3>
    <p class="first-para-section">Unlike in many of Elgar’s earlier works, the theme of conflict between an individual (or individuals) and a community is not prominent in <em>The Kingdom</em>. The oratorio has sometimes been criticised for lacking a strong protagonist or antagonist and thus the kind of focus and dramatic impetus that was present in its predecessor, <em>The Apostles</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref133" href='#_ftn133'>[133]</a> But by taking the emphasis away from individual characters, Elgar puts the spotlight instead on the community, thus creating a collective protagonist, a group of people united by a common will. Glenn Stanley has observed a similar phenomenon in relation to the function of the chorus in <em>Parsifal</em> and <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, works in which ‘the chorus no longer functions primarily as a stage-filling sonorous backdrop for the leading characters […], but rather, […] acts as a collective protagonist, whose condition and fate are fused with those of the individuals’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref134" href='#_ftn134'>[134]</a> Similarly, in <em>The Kingdom</em>, the will of the community of disciples and holy women is indistinguishable from those individuals who comprise it and from ‘The People’ who convert to Christianity in Scene III. As in <em>Caractacus</em> and <em>Cockaigne</em>, the communal theme of <em>The Kingdom</em> is complemented by the pairing of the keys of Eb and C major, which are most prominent in the first and last scenes of the work.</p>
    <p>Robert Bailey and William Kinderman have both observed Wagner’s practice of subtly indicating in the preludes to some of his music dramas the keys (or often a tonal pairing) that will be prominent in the music that follows.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref135" href='#_ftn135'>[135]</a> In the prelude to <em>The Kingdom</em> Elgar, too, signals the importance of both Eb major (the key in which the whole work begins and ends) and C major, which together form a tonal pairing (Elgar did something similar in <em>Caractacus</em>; see above). While the significance of Eb is obvious from the start, C major is more subtly introduced by two statements of what Jaeger labelled the ‘Gospel’ motif during bars 16–19, and by the first-inversion C major chords in bars 24–5.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref136" href='#_ftn136'>[136]</a> The central section of the prelude then moves to Db major for the first presentation of the ‘New Faith’ motif (Ex. 2.4) before returning to the realm of Eb at fig. 11. The C major chord at fig. 12, dissonant against the Ab in the bass, further hints at the significance of C but the elided perfect authentic cadence in Eb major at fig. 13 suggests that there is no real challenge to the key of Eb after all. However, the unexpected move to C major at the very end of the prelude (Ex. 2.12), via the introduction of the B♮ at 15:9, establishes C’s importance and challenges the dominance of Eb, which up until that point occupied the ‘primary position’ in the pairing.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref137" href='#_ftn137'>[137]</a> This cadence in C sets up an ambiguity that is only resolved (though not entirely convincingly) in the final bars of the work.</p>

    <p>      As in many of Elgar’s earlier works, stretching back to <em>The</em> <em>Black Knight</em>, C major has an associative significance in <em>The Kingdom</em>. Julian Rushton has compared the end of the prelude to <em>The Kingdom</em> with ‘Siegfried’s Rhine Journey’ in <em>Götterdämmerung</em>, the music that links the prologue to the beginning of Act I.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref138" href='#_ftn138'>[138]</a> This music, like that of <em>The Kingdom</em>’s prelude, modulates to a new key to prepare for the introduction of the Gibichungs, who ‘In this operatic tetralogy of giants, gods, and heroes […] represent ordinary, venal humanity’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref139" href='#_ftn139'>[139]</a> Similarly, the first scene of <em>The Kingdom</em>, immediately following the prelude, is, Rushton observes, representative of ‘a purely human world’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref140" href='#_ftn140'>[140]</a> The people populating this ‘human world’ in Elgar’s oratorio are in fact a tight-knit community (without the moral corruption present in the Hall of the Gibichungs) consisting of the disciples and the holy women in the Upper Room. The use of C major to introduce this group (the first chord sung by them is also C major) is perfectly consistent with the use of this key to represent similar earthly communities in earlier works by Wagner and by Elgar himself.</p>
    <p>      Byron Adams has written that by 1906 ‘both Wagner and decadence were falling out of favour’ in Britain and, consequently, <em>The Kingdom</em> is the least Wagnerian of Elgar’s mature oratorios: ‘the scarlet and golden threads of <em>fin de siècle</em> aesthetics that glisten through the polyphonic tapestries of <em>Gerontius</em> and <em>The Apostles</em> are rarely discerned in <em>The Kingdom</em>’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref141" href='#_ftn141'>[141]</a> Elgar himself told Jaeger that <em>The Kingdom</em> was ‘intentionally less mystic’ than <em>The Apostles</em>: ‘the men are alive &amp; working &amp; the atmosphere is meant to be more direct and simple’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref142" href='#_ftn142'>[142]</a> While it is undoubtedly true that the musical surface of <em>The Kingdom</em> is less Wagnerian than <em>Gerontius</em> and <em>The Apostles</em>, and that it lacks the Parsifalian mysticism of those earlier works, there is more to Elgar’s Wagnerism than the <em>fin-de-siècle</em> decadence that Adams describes. Rather than indicating a move away from Wagner altogether, <em>The Kingdom</em> marks a shift from one aspect of Wagnerian influence to another: from the <em>Parsifal</em>-esque decadence and mysticism of <em>Gerontius</em> and <em>The Apostles</em> (and the associated Ab/D complex in the latter), to the more <em>Meistersinger</em>-esque earthly concerns of community in <em>The</em> <em>Kingdom</em> (and the associated C/Eb complex).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref143" href='#_ftn143'>[143]</a></p>
    <p>      Soon after the start of the first scene of <em>The Kingdom</em>, C major gives way to F major, with distinct modal inflections stemming in particular from the latter half of the ‘O Sacrum Convivium’ melody (or ‘Real Presence’ motif).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref144" href='#_ftn144'>[144]</a> When C major eventually returns in Scene I, after some more music in Eb, its associative meaning is further elucidated by both text and music. It is at the words ‘In the concord of brethren, In the love of neighbours’ (just before fig. 29) that the realm of C reappears.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref145" href='#_ftn145'>[145]</a> C major remains the prevailing key, notwithstanding certain sections with strong modal elements,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref146" href='#_ftn146'>[146]</a> until the bar before fig. 35. Accompanying the words just before fig. 29 is the first appearance of a motif that is associated with ‘Fellowship’ in both this work and <em>The Apostles</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref147" href='#_ftn147'>[147]</a> The coming together of this text, motif and key clearly establishes a connection between C major and the notion of an ideal community based on brotherly love, religion and fellowship.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref148" href='#_ftn148'>[148]</a> The link between this key and the concept of fellowship is made yet more explicit in the first part of the work’s final scene, which is subtitled ‘In Fellowship’.</p>
    <p>There are no further extended sections of music in C major during Scene I, but the key is alluded to at the very end of the scene. At 51:3 the orchestra begins an almost exact recapitulation of the music from the start (b. 3) of the prelude, but now with the addition of the chorus. It is interesting that after thirteen bars of this repeated music the parallel with the prelude ends (at fig. 53) at the exact point where the C major statement of the ‘Gospel’ motif was stated in the prelude. The avoidance of C major here might seem to indicate the subjugation of this key to Eb, the key in which the scene ends, and which thus assumes the primary position in the tonal pairing once more. However, the resolution in Eb at the end of the scene is weak and C major remains implicitly present due to the b♮ and the G major chord of which it is a part in the antepenultimate and penultimate bars of the scene (Ex. 2.13). This chord recalls the sudden shift to C major at the end of the prelude, though this time the final sonority is an Eb chord. Here Elgar exploits the common-tone that belongs to both elements of the tonal pairing – G – a method often used by composers employing a double-tonic complex.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref149" href='#_ftn149'>[149]</a> The fact that it is 3/Eb<span class="comment"> (Should be scale degree on 3)</span> in the upper voice of the final chord adds to the weakness of the resolution in Eb and indicates the importance of C.</p>
    <p>      <em>The Kingdom</em>’s final scene is in many ways a musical and dramatic recapitulation of Scene I and the prelude. William Kinderman has noted that ‘the recapitulation or transformation of extended musical passages’ is an ‘architectural principle’ that is employed frequently in Wagner’s later works (especially in <em>Götterdämmerung</em>, <em>Tristan</em> and <em>Meistersinger</em>) and that this technique is often used ‘in conjunction with a pairing of keys’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref150" href='#_ftn150'>[150]</a> The tierce de Picardie effect of the C major chord immediately preceding the last scene is reminiscent of the end of the prelude, and here, too, this chord heralds the disciples and the holy women who are once again in the Upper Room. Initially, the tonality of the scene is somewhat ambiguous, with the music moving between the Aeolian mode on A and C major, but the <em>fortissimo</em> cadence at fig. 171 reaffirms C’s primacy in this sub-pairing (as it might be described) of C major/A Aeolian, as well as its importance in the larger-scale tonal pairing of Eb/C. As in Scene I, the music soon moves away from C major but returns to this key in a more extended section later in the Scene, subtitled ‘The Breaking of the Bread’. There is a parallel between this section and the Grail Knights’ communion scene in Act I of <em>Parsifal</em>, which is also in C major (at least when it starts and ends). The link with <em>Parsifal</em> is established not only by the shared tonality and similar subject matter of this scene, but also by the intertextual resonances of the ‘O Sacrum Convivium’ melody (Ex. 2.14), which contains within it both the opening four notes of <em>Parsifal</em>’s ‘Communion’ (or ‘Liebesmahl’) theme and the stepwise rising fourth that constitutes the ‘Spear’ motif. This ‘Real Presence’ motif, as Jaeger labelled it, appears at fig. 185 during ‘The Breaking of the Bread’ section, almost exactly as it was in Scene I (fig. 31). The resemblance to the ‘Spear’ motif is most apparent at the words ‘That hath dealt wondrously with us’ which appear in both the outer scenes, at 32:4 and 183:4 (immediately before ‘The Breaking of the Bread’), set to music based on the end of the ‘Sacrum’ chant.</p>

    </div> 

    <p>As has been observed by numerous scholars, the opening of the ‘Communion’ theme in <em>Parsifal</em> was adapted by Wagner from the start of Liszt’s ‘Excelsior’ prelude to <em>The Bells of Strasburg Cathedral</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref151" href='#_ftn151'>[151]</a> The first part of <em>Parsifal</em>’s ‘Grail’ motif (the rising whole tone and minor third) is also found in various pieces by Liszt, where it is frequently associated with the symbol of the cross, as in his oratorio <em>Die Legende von der Heiligen Elisabeth</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref152" href='#_ftn152'>[152]</a> The intervals of the rising motif at the start of <em>Parsifal</em> (Ex. 2.15) are found not just in Liszt’s ‘Excelsior’ prelude, but also in the theme heard at the start of <em>Elisabeth</em> (Ex. 2.16) which is based on a plainchant known as ‘Quasi Stella matutina’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref153" href='#_ftn153'>[153]</a> This plainchant is, in fact, based on exactly the same intervals as those found at the start of the ‘O Sacrum Convivium’ tune found in Elgar’s <em>The Kingdom</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref154" href='#_ftn154'>[154]</a> Whether Elgar knew of all these connections between Wagner’s and Liszt’s works is not known, but he would have at least read in Heintz’s analysis of <em>Parsifal</em> that Liszt’s ‘Cross’ motif was taken by Wagner from <em>Elisabeth</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref155" href='#_ftn155'>[155]</a> It is at least conceivable, then, that Elgar examined Liszt’s oratorio and noted the use of the opening plainchant and its resemblance to the start of <em>Parsifal</em> as well.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref156" href='#_ftn156'>[156]</a> The opening intervals of <em>Parsifal</em> are found yet again in a so-called ‘Master-phrase’, printed in a seventeenth-century book by Johann Christoph Wagenseil, which Wagner used as the basis of his ‘Banner’ (of the guild) motif in <em>Die Meistersinger</em> (the phrase from Wagenseil’s book is printed in Heintz’s analysis of <em>Die Meistersinger</em> as well, so Elgar would have known about it).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref157" href='#_ftn157'>[157]</a> Regardless of whether Elgar was aware of these intertextual connections between his own works and those of Wagner and Liszt, the fact that all three composers used similar musical material to represent similar extramusical ideas – the religiosity of <em>Elisabeth, Parsifal</em> and <em>The Kingdom</em>, but more specifically the idea of Christian fellowship in the latter two works – clearly demonstrates Elgar’s position in, and debt to, the Wagnerian-Lisztian tradition.</p>

    <p>      To return to the issue of large-scale recapitulation in <em>The Kingdom</em>, starting at fig. 187 there is an almost exact repeat in the orchestra of music from the latter part of the prelude (the music Jaeger described as a ‘devout prayer’),&#8288;<a id="_ftnref158" href='#_ftn158'>[158]</a> now transposed down a minor third from Eb major to C major. This repeat, which lasts 34 bars, concludes with a perfect authentic cadence in C major at fig. 190, which is analogous to the one in Eb at fig. 13 of the prelude. At this point, then, C major assumes the primary position in the tonal pairing, but in a reversal of the events of the prelude the music following this journeys slowly back towards Eb. At fig. 198, where the change of key signature and the ‘New Faith’ motif confirm that Eb has regained the primary position in the pairing, the music returns to the repeat of the prelude from where the cadence in C at fig. 190 left off. The Eb statement of ‘New Faith’ is parallel to fig. 13, but more exact is the repeat of the ‘devout prayer’ music that brought the prelude to an end: 199:7–201:5 parallels 14:6–15:9. The crucial difference here, however, is that the B♮ from the final bars of the prelude is effectively neutralised by being respelled as Cb, and the following chord is not C major, as in the prelude, but Eb major, in which key, after a final Dresden-Amen-like ascent based on the ‘New Faith’ motif, the oratorio ends (Ex. 2.17).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref159" href='#_ftn159'>[159]</a></p>

    <p>However, as in other works by Elgar that have double-tonic complexes, the final resolution does not seem entirely convincing, not least because Elgar ‘avoids any hint of the security of a Perfect Authentic Cadence’ in the final bars.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref160" href='#_ftn160'>[160]</a> By contrast, C major is affirmed by a perfect authentic cadence during this scene, albeit a <em>pianissimo</em> one, and by the grand imperfect authentic cadence earlier on. Rushton proposes that the ‘gentle let-down’ at the end of <em>The Kingdom</em> and the Second Symphony ‘represented a recognition of the inevitable failure of such evangelising projects’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref161" href='#_ftn161'>[161]</a> While Elgar might well have lost some of his earlier faith in the mission of the Empire and in the divine, mystical aspects of Christianity by the time he completed <em>The Kingdom</em>, I would suggest that he held on to the earthly notion of Christian fellowship and the associated sense of community that is apparent in <em>The Kingdom</em>.</p>
    <p>In examinations of works in which double-tonic complexes are present, the musical conflict between the two tonalities of the pairing is often considered to be representative of some kind of extramusical conflict or opposition as well, particularly in texted and programmatic compositions (as in <em>Caractacus</em> and <em>Falstaff</em>).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref162" href='#_ftn162'>[162]</a> In <em>The Kingdom</em>, however, no such analogous dramatic conflict is present. It is better to regard C and Eb as representing two sides of the same coin. While C major is associated specifically with a Wagnerian notion of fellowship, Eb major may be linked, as Patrick McCreless has claimed it is in <em>The Apostles</em>, with the early Christian church.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref163" href='#_ftn163'>[163]</a> There is a potential Wagnerian source for the associative significance of this key, too: <em>Tannhäuser</em>, a drama in which Eb is associated with ‘the Pilgrims and the divine realm of which they are the earthly representatives’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref164" href='#_ftn164'>[164]</a> Similarly, the disciples in <em>The Kingdom</em> are God’s representatives on earth. The connection to <em>Tannhäuser</em> is further strengthened by the fact that the ‘New Faith’ theme is similar to a motif heard at bars 55–61 of the prelude to Act III of the opera (a prelude which is in Eb and depicts the Pilgrims’ journey).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref165" href='#_ftn165'>[165]</a> This music from <em>Tannhäuser</em> (Ex. 2.18) is, in turn, based on the Dresden Amen, linking <em>Tannhäuser</em> to <em>Parsifal</em>, and thus creating an intertextual web of allusions between these two operas and Elgar’s oratorio. If, then, Eb signifies the early Christians themselves and their church, and C represents the kind of relationship and atmosphere that existed between them (fellowship), the combination of the two might be said to create an associative tonal pairing linked to the overarching idea of community. Furthermore, the C/Eb pairing harks back, as it did in <em>Cockaigne</em> and <em>Caractacus</em>, to the overture to <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, the Wagnerian opera which is most explicitly concerned with an earthly community. The difference between <em>The Apostles</em> and its intentionally less mystical sequel is highlighted by the use of the Parsifalian Ab/D keys in one and the <em>Meistersinger</em>-esque C/Eb keys in the other. That <em>The Kingdom</em> is more earthbound than the earlier oratorio is finally demonstrated by the ending of each work: while <em>The Apostles</em> concludes with a ‘Mystic Chorus’ singing ‘In Heaven’, <em>The Kingdom</em> with a scene populated only by mortal human beings.</p>

    <h2>2.4 Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">Adams writes that in the early twentieth century ‘a new generation of composers rejected the enervated chromatic twilight of the decadent Wagner in favour of healthy, manly diatonic sunlight’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref166" href='#_ftn166'>[166]</a> It must be remembered, however, that the ‘decadent Wagner’ was not the only Wagner, as Charles Stanford was keen to point out.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref167" href='#_ftn167'>[167]</a> There is more than an element of ‘diatonic sunlight’ in <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, and this light shines, too, in those works of Elgar that have been discussed above. While this diatonic, <em>Meistersinger</em>-esque strand of Wagnerism found little favour among the generation of (post-)Wagnerian composers born after Elgar, the ends for which Elgar enlisted this kind of Wagnerism were similar to those of later British musical Wagnerism. Elgar’s portrayal of ideal communities was part of a reaction against a disenchanted, fractured modern society; for him, a return of the kind of <em>Gemeinschaft</em> social relations depicted in his works was required in order to achieve national regeneration. In this respect, there are parallels with the communal dimension of Boughton’s Wagnerian project (see Chapter 4), even though Boughton came from the other end of the political spectrum. For the two composers considered in the next chapter, however, the desire for re-enchantment was expressed in rather different ways.∎</p>

Practically all of Elgar’s allusions to Wagner are what Christopher Reynolds refers to as ‘assimilative’ allusions rather than ‘contrastive’ allusions: ‘that is to say, an allusion can accept the meaning of the earlier text or use it to create another meaning, even a contrary meaning’. Christopher Alan Reynolds, <em>Motives for Allusion</em> (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2003), 16.

      <p><a id="_ftn24" href='#_ftnref24'>[24]</a> The allusion to Wagner’s ‘Spear’ motif in the motto theme of Elgar’s First Symphony solidifies the association with love as it is precisely this stepwise rising fourth from Ab to Db (as well as the C and Bb which follow it) that is used to set the words ‘um unsere Liebe’ in <em>Parsifal</em>’s Act I communion scene. This ‘Spear’ allusion has been identified by numerous scholars: McVeigh, <em>Edward Elgar, his Life and Music</em>, 197; Hepokoski, ‘Elgar’, in Holoman (ed.), <em>The Nineteenth-Century Symphony</em>, 330–1; Harper-Scott, <em>Edward Elgar, Modernist</em>, 189–90; Thomson, ‘Elgar and Chivalry’, 261–2. </p>
      <p><a id="_ftn25" href='#_ftnref25'>[25]</a> These links include the fact that both <em>The Apostles</em> and the First Symphony were linked by Elgar to ‘hope’ and ‘love’, just as Wagner described the prelude to <em>Parsifal</em> as ‘Love–Faith:–Hope?’. On <em>The Apostles</em>’s paratext, see Brian Trowell, ‘Elgar’s Use of Literature’, in Raymond Monk (ed.), <em>Edward Elgar: Music and Literature</em> (Aldershot: Scolar Press, 1993), 238–239. Elgar’s remark about the First Symphony is quoted in Jerrold Northrop Moore (ed.), <em>Edward Elgar: Letters of a Lifetime</em> (Oxford: Clarendon, 1990), 205. Elgar could well have read Wagner’s <em>Parsifal</em> programme in the copies of William Ashton Ellis’s translations of Wagner’s <em>Prose Works</em>, which he received at Christmas 1902.

      <p><a id="_ftn26" href='#_ftnref26'>[26]</a> Allen Gimbel has argued that one of the main themes in Elgar’s Second Symphony alludes to the <em>Preislied</em> from <em>Die Meistersinger</em>.

      <p><a id="_ftn28" href='#_ftnref28'>[28]</a> Both associative tonality and tonal pairing can function independently of mode: Bailey explains that in Wagner, for instance, ‘the “chromatic” or mixed major-minor mode’ is so frequently used that ‘the major and minor modes have by this point become equivalent and interchangeable, […] either one can substitute for the other’. Bailey, ‘An Analytical Study of the Sketches and Drafts’, 116. Bailey’s student, Patrick McCreless, has also stated that ‘the music of the period [the late nineteenth century] in essence involves twelve chromatic keys rather than the twenty-four diatonic keys of the earlier tonal practice’. McCreless, <em>Wagner’s Siegfried</em>, 170. On the same page, McCreless writes that ‘associative relationships are independent of mode’, at least with regards to the <em>Ring</em>. Following Bailey and McCreless, J. P. E. Harper-Scott has written that ‘composers after <em>Tristan</em> could treat the parallel major and minor modes as different sides of the same coin’. Harper-Scott, ‘Elgar’s Invention of the Human: <em>Falstaff</em>, Opus 68’, 241. For the purposes of the following discussion, I suggest that while it is sometimes useful to consider the keys of tonal pairings to be independent of mode, when it comes to associative tonality, and especially intertextual associative tonality, mode is in fact significant.</p>

Bribitzer-Stull, ‘The End of <em>Die Feen</em> and Wagner’s Beginnings’, 321.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn30" href='#_ftnref30'>[30]</a> David Fanning has considered the intertextual associations of C major by surveying its symbolic use across a wide range of nineteenth- and (predominantly) twentieth-century compositions. He argues that the tonality is consistently associated, in that period of history at least, with four themes in particular: Authority (national and religious), Nature, Childlike Simplicity and Classicism (to these, he adds ‘musical functions’ of C major, such as when it acts as a ‘goal of transformation’). Although none of these categories explicitly include the ideas of community, society, or the populace, community could conceivably be linked to the first three of Fanning’s categories. The idea of national authority is certainly related to ideas of society or community, and, in fact, Fanning places the final chorus of <em>Die Meistersinger</em> in his ‘Authority (nation)’ list. There is a link between ‘nature’ and the notion of an ideal community which might be considered to emerge as a ‘natural’ form of social organisation. There is also a parallel between the innocence associated with childlike simplicity and the innocence of an uncorrupted community.

The Elgars visited Nuremberg during their first trip to Bavaria in 1892, just two days after attending a performance of <em>Die Meistersinger</em> at Bayreuth. While there, they drove around the castle walls and visited the house, monument and grave of the principal character of Wagner’s opera, Hans Sachs. Bird (ed.), <em>Diaries 1857–1896</em>, 197–198. That Elgar saw Nuremberg through the lens of Longfellow as well as Wagner is evidenced by a letter he wrote to some of his nephews and nieces, in which he referred to Longfellow’s poem, ‘Nuremberg’.

      <p><a id="_ftn37" href='#_ftnref37'>[37]</a> The Elgars only visited Bayreuth on their first trip (1892) during which they saw <em>Parsifal</em> on two consecutive days. Most of the Wagner productions they attended were in Munich.</p>

Reynolds for allowing me to view Elgar’s own, annotated copies of the analyses which are in his possession.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn83" href='#_ftnref83'>[83]</a> Elgar’s remarks about the importance of the artist ‘mixing with his fellows’, for example, might also have been inspired by a passage in Longfellow’s <em>Hyperion</em>. During a conversation between the book’s main character, Paul Flemming, and the Baron of Hohenfels, with whom Flemming is spending the winter in Heidelberg, the Baron poses the question of where ‘the scholar’, or ‘poet’ (that is, the artist) should live: ‘In solitude, or in society?’. The Baron then answers his own question: ‘acting, thinking, rejoicing, sorrowing, with his fellow-men;—such, such should be the poet’s life […]. The mind of the scholar […] should come in contact with other minds’. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, <em>Hyperion, A Romance</em>, 7th ed. (Boston: William D. Ticknor &amp; Co., 1850), 75. Leon Botstein has also considered John Ruskin’s and Cardinal Newman’s impact on Elgar’s notion of community and the importance to all three men of art or religion, or both, in helping to form such community. Botstein, ‘Transcending the Enigmas of Biography’, 382–389, 397.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn84" href='#_ftnref84'>[84]</a> This work is a setting of Longfellow’s translation (found in <em>Hyperion</em>) of Ludwig Uhland’s poem <em>Der Schwarze Ritter</em>. Unlike the examples from Wagner’s operas given by Darcy, the conflict between the individual and community in <em>The Black Knight</em> is not resolved by the former either transcending or merging with the social world, but the choice of text, along with its medieval setting, nonetheless points to Wagner’s influence. Aidan Thomson has interpreted the work as an ‘inversion’ of the <em>Parsifal</em> narrative, and suggested that ‘the realm’ depicted in <em>The Black Knight</em> is ‘a metaphor for German musical hegemony, threatened by a mysterious stranger from outside the organic community envisioned in <em>Parsifal</em>’. Aidan J. Thomson, ‘Re-reading Elgar: Hermeneutics, Criticism and Reception in England and Germany, 1900–1914’ (D.Phil. diss., University of Oxford, 2002), 122.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn85" href='#_ftnref85'>[85]</a> Byron Adams has suggested another possible source for Elgar’s association of particular keys with specific moods and ideas: he observes that Elgar’s ‘choice of keys in certain of his scores’ ‘may have been influenced, consciously or unconsciously’ by the ‘theory of keys’ put forwards in Ernst Pauer’s <em>The Elements of the Beautiful in Music</em> (a book owned by Elgar). As well as being ‘expressive of innocence’ (as it often is in both Elgar and Wagner), Pauer writes that C major can express ‘deep religious feeling’ and it is evidently this kind of religiosity that is conveyed by ‘Aspiration’. Adams, ‘Elgar and the Persistence of Memory’, 79. Ernst Pauer, <em>The Elements of the Beautiful in Music</em> (London: Novello, Ewer and Co., 1877), 23. As noted above, it would be an oversimplification to suggest that Elgar’s use of certain keys was entirely determined by their extramusical significance in Wagner. Nonetheless, as with the <em>Die Meistersinger</em> allusion in <em>The Black Knight</em> and the similarity between the scene depicted in ‘Aspiration’ and the start of Act I of <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, the connection to Wagner is often supported by not only the tonality, but also by various other elements of the music, text, and paratext.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn86" href='#_ftnref86'>[86]</a> Elgar saw the <em>Ring</em> in its entirety in Munich in 1893. Moore, <em>Edward Elgar: A Creative Life</em>, 176. Other works by Elgar, including <em>Caractacus</em>, and his incidental music for <em>Diarmuid and Grania</em> and <em>King Arthur</em>, were also inspired by the kind of mythology that had, at least in part, been made popular by the cult of Wagnerism. These works, however, are based on Celtic myths, rather than the Norse and Germanic legends that inspired <em>King Olaf</em> and the <em>Ring</em>.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn87" href='#_ftnref87'>[87]</a> For biographical details about Acworth and details of his and Elgar’s collaboration on <em>Caractacus</em>, see Charles Edward McGuire, ‘Elgar and Acworth’s <em>Caractacus</em>: the Druids, Race, and the Individual Hero’, in Harper-Scott and Rushton (eds.), <em>Elgar Studies</em>, 50–77.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn88" href='#_ftnref88'>[88]</a> Róisín Blunnie writes that ‘Elgar and Acworth sanitised the character of Olaf and afforded greater attention to his more romantic, admirable and heroic traits’. Róisín Blunnie, ‘A High-Victorian Spyglass: <em>Scenes from the Saga of King Olaf</em> and Late Nineteenth-Century British Idealism’, <em>Elgar Society Journal</em>, 15/1 (Mar. 2007), 5–14 at 7. Ernest Newman observed the ‘absurdity’ of the end of <em>King Olaf</em> when ‘Olaf, who has been drawn as a quarrelsome, high-spirited, land-grabbing, bad-mannered, courageous Viking—a real creature of his day—is made to figure as a saint in whose life and death are symbolised the struggle and triumph of the Christian faith. […] All through the cantata there is the same alternate presentation of Olaf as the pirate and the saint’. Ernest Newman, <em>Elgar</em> (London: John Lane, The Bodley Head, 1906), 33–34. Matthew Riley remarks that ‘The final libretto [of <em>King Olaf</em>] legitimises Olaf’s assault by painting the pagan religion as black as possible’. Matthew Riley, <em>Edward Elgar and the Nostalgic Imagination</em> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), 156.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn89" href='#_ftnref89'>[89]</a> Blunnie notes that this scene was quite dramatically altered by Acworth (and presumably the composer approved): ‘In Longfellow the pagans were forced to convert on pain of death: through absolute necessity and a complete lack of alternatives. In Acworth’s revision the defeated men of Drontheim, awe-struck by the heavenly vision of the holy cross, are thereby convinced of the power and superiority of Christianity and humbly seek baptism’. Ibid. 9. Michael Pope also discusses Elgar and Acworth’s restructuring of Longfellow’s Saga in ‘<em>King Olaf</em> and the English Choral Tradition’, in Monk (ed.), <em>Elgar Studies</em>, 60–62.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn90" href='#_ftnref90'>[90]</a> Elgar did not use C major exclusively for communal scenes, however, as illustrated by the duet ‘The Gray Land Breaks to Lively Green’, the only other section in the work where the key is really prominent. In this section, C major is used for its association with nature, an association common to the works of various nineteenth- and twentieth-century composers. See Fanning, ‘Shostakovich: “The Present-Day Master of the C Major Key”’, 105.</p>

      <p><a id="_ftn93" href='#_ftnref93'>[93]</a> Percy Young has suggested that ‘there is the germ’ of the ‘New Faith’ theme in a triplet-inflected motif in Elgar’s first oratorio, <em>The Light of Life</em>. See the chorus ‘Light Out of Darkness’, at the words ‘Thou hast born The sinner’s sentence and his shame; Thy side was pierced, Thy forehead torn, Thy sad heart broken, broken by our blame’. Percy M. Young, <em>Elgar O. M. A Study of a Musician</em>, revised. ed. (London: White Lion Publishers, 1973), 309.

Julian Rushton, ‘Musicking <em>Caractacus</em>’, in Bennett Zon (ed.), <em>Music and Performance Culture in Nineteenth-Century Britain: Essays in Honour of Nicholas Temperley</em> (Farnham: Ashgate, 2012), 221–40 at 232. </p>

      <p><a id="_ftn98" href='#_ftnref98'>[98]</a> The end of <em>Die Meistersinger</em> is also very nationalistic but it is primarily a celebration of Germany as a ‘<em>Kulturnation</em>’ rather than as a ‘<em>Staatsnation</em>’; the former, it is implied, will endure in spite of the dissolution of the latter.

      <p><a id="_ftn105" href='#_ftnref105'>[105]</a> C major is also present in Scene III during the chorus of the youths and maidens, where the key seems to have been employed simply to express innocence.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn106" href='#_ftnref106'>[106]</a> There are plenty of other examples that demonstrate the associative significance of C and Eb. For example, when Eigen, Orbin and Caractacus sing together in Scene I, after their concluding words ‘my father, the glory of Britain and thee’ (and ‘O Britain the triumph of thee’), there follows (shortly after fig. 52) one of the strongest perfect authentic cadences in Eb in the scene (though it is an elided cadence), immediately preceded by a fragmented version of the motif associated with Britain. This motif appears again in Eb in Scene II (fig. 23), when the Arch-Druid says to the British King, Caractacus, ‘Go forth, O King to conquer, And all the land shall know, When falls thy charmed sword edge, In thunder on the foe’. Some of these words are then echoed by the chorus, but when the chorus repeat the last word, ‘foe’, there is a sudden V6/5/c chord which pushes the music back towards C minor for the next words sung by the Arch-Druid, that begin ‘But Rome’.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn107" href='#_ftnref107'>[107]</a> Elgar sent a vocal score with his own descriptions of ‘salient themes’ to the <em>Yorkshire Post</em>’s critic Herbert Thompson, who wrote the programme notes for <em>Caractacus</em>’s premiere in Leeds.

Thomson writes that this ‘strange alliance was cemented by three factors: a shared belief in “traditional” values; an acknowledgment by the upper classes of the need for social reform […]; and a belief in imperial expansion’. Ibid. 227–228, 233. This ‘one-nation’ conservatism is similar to the kind of Conservative collectivism discussed above.</p>

It is not known to what extent Bennett’s programme reflects Elgar’s intentions. Elgar explained to Bennett that at one point a ‘military band passes’ but otherwise left the programme up to the critic, whom Elgar thought would not have ‘much trouble in describing’ the work. Moore (ed.), <em>Letters of a Lifetime</em>, 94. Most of Bennett’s descriptions are plausible, and the similarities with the <em>Meistersinger</em> overture support his interpretation. Bennett’s association of certain themes with Londoners, young Londoners, lovers and a church are therefore followed here, as they have been by most commentators on <em>Cockaigne</em> from 1901 all the way up to Thomson’s recent article.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn116" href='#_ftnref116'>[116]</a> Thomson refers to them as the ‘Citizen’ (as Edwin Evans described it) and ‘Cockney’ themes, which are rather less neutral terms and therefore not adopted here.</p>

      <p><a id="_ftn120" href='#_ftnref120'>[120]</a> Thomson suggests that <em>Cockaigne</em>’s C major might be the key of ‘nature’, as it is in Strauss’s <em>Also Sprach Zarathustra</em>, and thus linked to some kind of Darwinian struggle. Thomson, ‘Elgar and the City’, 252.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn121" href='#_ftnref121'>[121]</a> In Bennett’s original description of the overture he imagines the whole work to be seen from the perspective of two lovers taking a walk through the streets of London on a fine afternoon. He describes the theme specifically associated with the lovers as ‘The Lovers’ Romance’. ‘Comments and Opinions’, <em>Musical Standard</em>, 15 (29 Jun. 1901), 399. The analysis of <em>Die Meistersinger</em> owned by Elgar quotes Wagner describing the E-major motif as ‘a secretly whispered declaration of love’.

      <p><a id="_ftn122" href='#_ftnref122'>[122]</a> By contrast, Thomson suggests that the ‘interjections’ of the ‘Cockney’ and ‘Lovers’ themes in conjunction with the ‘Church’ theme show that ‘the Church cannot maintain […] coherence within an urban environment’.

      <p><a id="_ftn123" href='#_ftnref123'>[123]</a> The ‘Banner’ motif is also known as the ‘King David’ motif or (as it is described in the Heintz analysis) ‘Meistersinger March’ motif.</p>

      <p><a id="_ftn143" href='#_ftnref143'>[143]</a> C major is also present in the Act I communion scene of <em>Parsifal</em>, so the distinction is not entirely clear-cut. Nonetheless, there is still a clear shift from the mystical, esoteric Parsifalian aesthetic to a more down-to-earth aesthetic. The links between the <em>The Kingdom</em> and <em>Parsifal</em> are discussed below.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn144" href='#_ftnref144'>[144]</a> ‘Modal’ refers here to the scales known as Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian and Locrian. ‘O Sacrum Convivium’ is the plainchant upon which the theme is based; ‘Real Presence’ is the name given to the motif by Jaeger. Jaeger, <em>The Kingdom</em>, 6.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn145" href='#_ftnref145'>[145]</a> Initially the music flirts with both the major and minor modes of C, suggesting the use of the ‘“chromatic” mode of C’ – the kind discussed by Bailey and McCreless in relation to Wagner.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn146" href='#_ftnref146'>[146]</a> Julian Rushton highlights the pairing (‘modal pairings’, rather than tonal pairings) of the Ionian and Aeolian modes, and the Lydian and Dorian modes during the first scene. Rushton, ‘Elgar, Kingdom, and Empire’, 25 (n. 7).</p>

      <p><a id="_ftn148" href='#_ftnref148'>[148]</a> Describing Scene I in general, Jaeger writes that ‘its quasi-conversational style admirably suggests the gathering of the small Messianic community swayed by the impulse of Fellowship’. Jaeger, <em>The Kingdom</em>, 10.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn149" href='#_ftnref149'>[149]</a> Christopher Lewis lists the exploitation of ‘ambiguous and common harmonic functions’ as one of four common ways in which tonal pairing presents itself on the musical surface of a work.

      <p><a id="_ftn154" href='#_ftnref154'>[154]</a> The resemblance between these two chants (though not in relation to Elgar) is pointed out in Wilford Davis Smith, <em>Stylistic Treatment of Gregorian Melody in Selected Works of Seventeen Composers</em>, PhD diss., University of Texas, 1955, 134.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn155" href='#_ftnref155'>[155]</a> Albert Heintz, <em>Parsifal</em>, 12.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn156" href='#_ftnref156'>[156]</a> There is no hard evidence to show that Elgar knew of Liszt’s use of a similar chant. Elgar wrote to his friend Hubert Leicester, in December 1902, asking for a ‘harmonised or any other version of the old Gregorian Antiphon <em>O Sacrum Convivium</em>’, and it was one of the examples sent by Leicester that Elgar used in <em>The Kingdom</em>. See Moore (ed.), <em>Letters of a Lifetime</em>, 123–124.</p>

      <p><a id="_ftn159" href='#_ftnref159'>[159]</a> This method of resolving an important chromatic element, first introduced near the start of the work, at the very end of the work is also apparent in <em>The Apostles</em>. McCreless points out that the E♮ (which has the same relationship to the work’s opening key of Ab as the B♮ in <em>The Kingdom</em> does to Eb), first introduced near the start of the Prologue, is ultimately resolved in the final pages (at fig. 236), by way of an enharmonic respelling of the E♮ as Fb (in part of another Dresden-Amen-inspired rising motion).

      <p><a id="_ftn162" href='#_ftnref162'>[162]</a> As Boyd Pomeroy has observed, ‘In nineteenth-century repertoires, the perceived presence of such pairings […] is often justified by external elements—for instance, music/ text relations, dramatic symbolism, or an extra-musical program’. Boyd Pomeroy, ‘Tales of Two Tonics: Directional Tonality in Debussy’s Orchestral Music’, <em>Music Theory Spectrum</em>, 26/1 (Spr. 2004), 87–118 at 89. To give just one example, William Kinderman has written that ‘At the end of the first act of <em>Tristan</em>, […] Wagner employs a pairing and alternation of A minor and C major to underscore the dichotomy between the realm of the lovers and the external world, the dreaded realm of “Day”’. Kinderman, ‘Wagner’s Parsifal: Musical Form and the Drama of Redemption’, 432.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn163" href='#_ftnref163'>[163]</a> ‘Eb major anchors the work of Jesus and the work of the apostles; it is the key of the beginning of the church’. McCreless, ‘Elgar and Theories of Chromaticism’, 38.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn164" href='#_ftnref164'>[164]</a> Bailey, ‘The Structure of the <em>Ring</em> and its Evolution’, 52. Eb as a tonal ‘sonority’ is strongly associated with the opening of <em>Das Rheingold</em>, the legacy of which one might hear in the closing pages of Sibelius’s Fifth Symphony, at the start and end of Bruckner’s Fourth Symphony, and perhaps even the endings of <em>The Apostles</em> and <em>The Kingdom</em>. The association with the Rhine at the start of the <em>Ring</em> suggests the key’s association with a ‘natural’ state of things (an association more often linked to C major). Elgar would, of course, have known the heroic associations of Eb, as the Straussian main theme in that key in <em>In the South</em> demonstrates, but his use of that key in <em>The Kingdom</em> seems to constitute more of a ‘deherorising’ of Eb.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn165" href='#_ftnref165'>[165]</a> The <em>Manchester Guardian</em>’s correspondent noted this resemblance after the oratorio’s 1906 premiere in Birmingham. ‘Birmingham Festival: First Performance of “The Kingdom”’, <em>Manchester Guardian</em>, 4 Oct. 1906, 6.</p>
