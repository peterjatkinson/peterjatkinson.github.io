    <h1>POSTLUDE</h1>
    <p class="first-para-section dropcap">Taking into account the various manifestations of British Wagnerism that have been considered in this thesis as a whole, it is clear that, while the Wagnerism of British composers and their collaborators was eclectic, inconsistent and even contradictory at times, there were also many common threads in their responses to Wagner and, in certain respects, there was a discernible sense of development of the phenomenon during the period 1880–1920. This development took various forms, but three areas in particular may be highlighted. First, there was a purely musical kind of development that took place in three broad stages: beginning in the 1880s there were attempts to employ only limited aspects of Wagnerian technique within works that were to a significant extent still based on more conventional operatic practices;&#8288;<a id="_ftnref1" href='#_ftn1'>[1]</a> second, in the 1890s, some composers began to adopt Wagnerian procedures far more consistently in conscious attempts to imitate the Meister; finally, in the years leading up to the First World War, the growing influence on British composers of a much younger generation of composers from the Continent, in particular Strauss and Debussy, meant that even the most dedicated of Wagnerians wrote in a musical style that, while rooted in Wagnerian practices, became at the same time increasingly distant from Wagner’s own compositional language – it became post-Wagnerian.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref2" href='#_ftn2'>[2]</a></p>
    <p>A second way in which the phenomenon of British Wagnerism in the musical sphere appears to have changed between its earlier and later phases concerns the popularity of certain kinds of subject matter. Specifically, there was a shift from a focus on historical and medieval themes and settings in earlier Wagner-influenced works (operas by Stanford, Mackenzie and Parry, and arguably even Wallace’s <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em>) to works that inhabit a more universalised, mythical world. Thus, even though both Parry and Boughton dealt with Arthurian legends, the latter’s <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> lacks the medieval atmosphere conjured up in <em>Guenever</em> by fighting knight scenes, chivalrous rhetoric and Pre-Raphaelite allusions. Instead, <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> has more in common with Holbrooke and Ellis’s <em>Cauldron of Annwn</em> trilogy, which seems to reach further back, beyond medieval times and into a timeless, dimly lit, animistic and elemental universe. This shift could be explained, in part, as a result of a concurrent shift in popularity of Wagner’s different works.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref3" href='#_ftn3'>[3]</a> His relatively conservative works such as <em>Die Meistersinger</em> and the earlier medieval operas <em>Lohengrin</em> and <em>Tannhäuser</em> exerted a far greater influence on Stanford, Parry and Mackenzie than on the younger generation who favoured the <em>Ring</em> and <em>Tristan</em> above all.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref4" href='#_ftn4'>[4]</a> The changing attitudes towards particular works during this forty-year period might also help to account for the short lifespan and limited reach of the <em>Meistersinger</em>-inspired strand of Wagnerism – a more restrained English strand – which appears to have been completely rejected by the younger generation.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref5" href='#_ftn5'>[5]</a></p>
    <p>Perhaps the most significant development in British Wagnerism between 1880 and 1920, however, was its increasing politicisation and its growing association with issues of race and nationalism. Such elements were present in earlier works like <em>Guenever</em> and <em>Caractacus</em> but in the former the national element was more subdued and in both works the racial aspect was not so affected by the eugenicist current that gained momentum in the early twentieth century. This heightened politicisation is also illustrated by a comparison of the 1890s compositions by Bantock and Wallace examined here with the later works by the other members of the RAM-Midlands group. In common with 1890s aestheticist manifestations of Wagnerism in the other arts, the focus on themes of love (erotic and divine) and transcendence in <em>Caedmar</em> and <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em> eschews the more overt politicisation of Wagnerism characteristic of works by Holbrooke, Boughton and Bax (at least in my readings of these works).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref6" href='#_ftn6'>[6]</a></p>
    <p>      If, then, there was a sense in which Wagnerism evolved between 1880 and 1920, there is a question of whether this development was a result of the relevant composers’ association with each other. Returning to Stradling and Hughes’s observations referred to in the Introduction,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref7" href='#_ftn7'>[7]</a> one might ask whether, through their shared engagement with Wagnerism, this group represented a serious vision of British music that was in some way ideologically and aesthetically unified, with their respective compositions shaping each other in some way, or if the works studied here are largely independent of one another.</p>
    <p>Many of the common themes among their Wagnerian works – including Celticism, cyclical and regenerative narratives, sublime and pantheistic representations of nature, liminality, inwardness and mysticism – could be dismissed as a result of wider artistic and cultural currents prominent at the time. But although direct causal links between individual works are difficult to prove, it makes sense, given these composers’ personal connections and knowledge of each other’s projects, to think of their Wagnerian compositions not in isolation but as part of a loosely-bound intertextual web of British musical Wagnerism in which the constituent elements are not always directly linked but, at the same time, cannot be thought of as entirely separate either.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref8" href='#_ftn8'>[8]</a></p>
    <p>It could certainly be argued that the subjects of the last four chapters of this thesis shared a musical-aesthetic programme, characterised by a belief that music should be inspired by ‘poetic ideas’ and express inward feelings and emotions; a preference for composing in the genres of programme music and opera; an anti-academic, anti-formalist stance towards composition; a desire to capture the spirit of folk music in an abstract sense but an avoidance, for the most part, of quoting or emulating its actual melodies; a tendency to compose ‘vertically’ rather than in a linear and contrapuntal style; lavish orchestration; and an inclination towards topics that are grandiose, exotic or colourful. </p>
    <p>Whether these composers shared a common and coherent ideological stance is more doubtful. As noted earlier, the RAM-Midlands group (excepting Elgar) were at least partly ideologically united by their espousal, through their musical works, of notions of British, not just English, nationalism.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref9" href='#_ftn9'>[9]</a> Although one should avoid drawing too simplistic a distinction between apparent groups or factions of British composers when such lines are often blurry, the focus of these composers on a Britishness that had its essence in the Celtic does distinguish them from those who promoted an Englishness inspired by such places as Hampshire and the New Forest, Somerset, Shropshire, the Cotswolds, and Norfolk and the Fens.</p>
    <p>The kind of Britain that the Wagnerites wanted, however, varied widely in a political sense. Indeed, one of the most striking contradictions of British music and Wagnerism is how Wagner’s methods and ideas were used as a vehicle for promoting such radically different or contradictory ideologies as Parry’s liberalism, Elgar’s collectivist conservatism, Boughton’s socialism, Holbrooke’s xenophobic protectionism and Bax’s Irish republicanism. However, these philosophies are perhaps not as different as they first seem, as for the most part they shared a desire for some kind of pre-Capitalist magic, myth and inspiration to rejuvenate the modern world – a belief that we must reach back in order to go forward. This of course brings us back to the overarching themes of Wagnerism identified in the Introduction: regeneration and re-enchantment. But even if we accept that British musical Wagnerism was, in the end, a movement characterised more by difference than cohesion, it is perhaps in that very difference that Wagnerism finds its most unifying characteristic: the use of Wagner’s methods and ideas as a launch pad for promoting one’s own agenda, whatever that might be.</p>

    <p class="first-para-section"><a id="_ftn1" href='#_ftnref1'>[1]</a> Such techniques as leitmotifs, a declamatory vocal style and through-composed structures. For a longer list of Wagnerian compositional techniques, see footnote 32 in the Introduction.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn2" href='#_ftnref2'>[2]</a> This post-Wagnerian musical vocabulary was characterised, among other elements, by a more frequent use of whole-tone scales and augmented sonorities; a greater focus on creating atmosphere, resulting in more harmonically static or tonally ambiguous sections; a more maximalised and dissonant harmonic language; and, in parallel with Wagnerism’s convergence with increasingly explicit expressions of nationalism in the twentieth century, there were more determined attempts to combine Wagnerian music with a vernacular musical language, especially through the use of the chorus. Such attempts to Anglicise Wagner had of course been typical of British musical Wagnerism since the 1880s, but in later years there was also a greater effort to Wagnerise the (English) chorus so that there was more of a fusion rather than a just a juxtaposition of Wagnerian and English musical characteristics (this distinction is aptly illustrated by the choruses in Parry’s <em>Guenever</em>, on the one hand, and those in Boughton’s <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> on the other).</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn3" href='#_ftnref3'>[3]</a> The observation that the direction of Wagner’s influence on subsequent generations of composers was shaped in large part by individual operas or music dramas rather than just an all-encompassing Wagner reception has been made by Carl Dahlhaus, who has written that ‘a distinction must be made among Wagner’s successors based on the works from which the influence emanated’. ‘We must distinguish’, Dahlhaus argues, ‘between the overall reception of Wagner and the history of the influence of individual works’. Carl Dahlhaus, ‘Wagner’s Musical Influence’, in Ulrich Müller and Peter Wapnewski (eds.), <em>Wagner Handbook</em>, trans. John Deathridge (London: Harvard University Press, 1992), 547–562 at 548.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn4" href='#_ftnref4'>[4]</a> In the case of Stanford, for example, <em>Tristan</em> was just too ‘crushingly chromatic’. Charles V. Stanford, <em>Interludes, Records and Reflections</em> (London: John Murray, 1922), 146. <em>Tristan</em> also has a medieval element, of course, but the subject matter of that work is much more universal or at least less dependent on historical setting.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn5" href='#_ftnref5'>[5]</a> This kind of Wagnerism, illustrated by works of Stanford, Parry and Elgar, was characterised variously by diatonicism, the use of the keys of C and Eb, themes of community, ‘“humorous” counterpoint’ or some extramusical comedic dimension, and significant allusions to <em>Die Meistersinger</em>. Jeremy Dibble writes of the ‘all-pervading topos of “humorous” counterpoint which runs through’ <em>The Canterbury Pilgrims</em> and which is also ‘an important dimension of <em>Die Meistersinger</em>’. Dibble, <em>Charles Villiers Stanford: Man and Musician</em> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), 155–7. This kind of counterpoint is also present in Elgar’s <em>Cockaigne</em>. In addition to the works of Elgar discussed in Chapter 2 and Stanford’s <em>The Canterbury Pilgrims</em>, Parry’s <em>Blest Pair of Sirens</em>, a work in Eb which alludes to <em>Die Meistersinger</em> in its opening gesture, could also be included in this category of Wagnerism. Jeremy Dibble has previously pointed out this allusion. Dibble, <em>C. Hubert Parry: His Life and Music</em> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992), 254.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn6" href='#_ftnref6'>[6]</a> This is not to deny that these works’ very distance from political concerns could itself be considered ideological, but they were not outwardly ideological in the way that Holbrooke or Boughton’s operas were, or Bax’s <em>Tintagel</em> was (in my reading). Emma Sutton argues that ‘we should be sceptical of the idea of <em>fin-de-siècle</em> art or aestheticism which was […] outside, or other than, political […] discourse’. However, at the end of her study she notes that Wagnerism ‘contributed’ to the ‘depoliticization’ of ‘<em>fin-de-siècle</em> aestheticism’. Sutton, <em>Aubrey Beardsley and British Wagnerism in the 1890s</em> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), 13, 199.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn7" href='#_ftnref7'>[7]</a> See page 4.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn8" href='#_ftnref8'>[8]</a> Parry and his opera <em>Guenever</em>, which was not known to any British composer other than Stanford, are not so clearly a part of this Wagnerian network. The connections between the other composers have been referred to earlier in the thesis, but it is worth reiterating some of the ways in which they could have shaped each other’s activities. Elgar in particular had a significant impact on the younger British Wagnerites. Bantock, Boughton and Bax all received musical advice from him directly, while the British-Celtic almost-opera <em>Caractacus</em> was influential on later Wagnerian operas with national and Celtic themes. Boughton was a great admirer of <em>Caractacus</em>, regarding it at one stage as the closest thing to a true national opera that had been produced, if only it had not taken the ‘mongrel form of the Cantata’. Rutland Boughton, ‘A National Opera. The Chances of it’, <em>Musical Standard</em>, 16 (10 Aug. 1901), 85. Bax also described the work as ‘half-cantata, half-opera’. Arnold Bax, <em>Farewell, My Youth and Other Writings by Arnold Bax</em>, ed. Lewis Foreman (Aldershot: Scolar, 1992), 124. Elgar’s more musically Wagnerian oratorios also encouraged the inclusion of the chorus and shaped the style of choral writing in subsequent Wagnerian British music dramas. Although Bantock’s <em>Caedmar</em> and Wallace’s <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em> were, in themselves, not nearly as influential as Elgar’s works on British Wagnerism, Bantock and Wallace played a crucial role in setting out a path for British musical progressivism in the 1890s that was rooted in Wagnerian aesthetics and which was then followed by Boughton, Holbrooke and Bax. Moreover, all of these composers frequently heard in private or attended performances of each other’s work: in addition to Bantock’s close individual relationships with Boughton and Holbrooke, the latter two composers would have been aware of each other’s operatic cycles, which they began working on at a similar time, and it seems likely that Bax also knew the music of other British Wagnerites (he was, for instance, at the premiere of Holbrooke’s <em>Apollo and the Seaman</em> in 1908). Bax, <em>Farewell, My Youth</em>, 80.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn9" href='#_ftnref9'>[9]</a> Even Bax’s Irish nationalism could be subsumed within a notion of British identity that located its essence in the Celt and the Celtic world. Hence Bax’s ability to believe that he had identified the ‘Celt within’ his entirely English, un-Celtic self.</p>
