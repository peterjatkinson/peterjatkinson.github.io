    <h1>CHAPTER 6</h1>
    <h1>Bax’s <em>Tintagel</em> and the Twilight of British Musical Wagnerism&#8288;<a id="_ftnref1" href='#_ftn1'>[1]</a></h1>
    <p class="first-para-section dropcap">Arnold Bax’s formative experiences of Wagner’s music are well documented by his biographers and in his autobiography, <em>Farewell, My Youth</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref2" href='#_ftn2'>[2]</a> In the latter, Bax recalled playing through Wagner’s works on the piano all day and night during his teenage years, and Lewis Foreman notes that the only scores Bax acquired in youth and kept until his death were his vocal scores of <em>Die Meistersinger</em> and <em>Tristan</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref3" href='#_ftn3'>[3]</a> As was the case with many other British Wagnerian composers, it was Bax’s studies at the Royal Academy of Music between 1900 and 1905 with Frederick Corder, whom Bax referred to as an ‘arch-Wagnerian’, that reinforced his burgeoning obsession with Wagner’s music dramas.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref4" href='#_ftn4'>[4]</a> By the time Bax completed his training at the RAM and embarked on his compositional career, the influence of Wagner had, to a certain degree, already been superseded by the influence of the post-Wagnerian music of Strauss and Debussy. Indeed, these composers, in addition to the likes of Delius, Rachmaninov, Tchaikovsky and Borodin, had no less of an impact on Bax’s early music than Wagner. Nonetheless, according to music critic Edwin Evans, Bax had become known above all as a Wagnerian composer by the end of the First World War.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref5" href='#_ftn5'>[5]</a> </p>
    <p>Bax’s Wagnerian reputation might have been a consequence of his engagement with the ‘pantheistic strain’ of British Wagnerism identified by Derrick Puffett. Puffett argues that the ‘vague pantheism’ of Bax’s early tone poems (such as <em>In the Faery Hills</em> (1909), <em>Christmas Eve on the Mountains</em> (1912), and <em>Nympholept</em> (1912)) would have been ‘unthinkable without the model of Wagner’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref6" href='#_ftn6'>[6]</a> As noted in Chapter 3, while Puffett suggested that the origins of this strand of Wagnerism were found in the Celtic works of <em>Tristan</em> and <em>Parsifal</em>, the <em>Ring</em> cycle, and in particular the ‘Waldweben’ music from Act II of <em>Siegfried</em>, was an equally important model. There are in fact echoes of the ‘Waldweben’ music in the oscillating woodwind figures found at the opening of Bax’s tone poem <em>November Woods</em> (1914–17), and ‘reminiscences of Wagner’s “Feuerzauber”’ music from <em>Die Walküre</em> were observed by one critic at the premiere of Bax’s <em>Christmas Eve on the Mountains</em>, a work which Evans suggested fuelled the ‘legend of his Wagnerism’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref7" href='#_ftn7'>[7]</a> These elements of Bax’s Wagnerism should, then, be seen in the context of earlier Wagnerian works with Celtic associations such as Bantock’s <em>Caedmar</em>, which expressed a pantheistic vision of nature through allusions to Wagner’s ‘Waldweben’ music (see Chapter 3).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref8" href='#_ftn8'>[8]</a> </p>
    <p>      Arguably Bax’s most Wagnerian work, however, was his tone poem <em>Tintagel</em> (completed in short score in October 1917 and orchestrated in January 1919), one of his best-known compositions which owes its Wagnerism not so much to the <em>Ring</em> but to the Celtic <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref9" href='#_ftn9'>[9]</a> Like so many other musical works from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that allude to Tintagel Castle, a monument of Celtic Cornwall, the title of Bax’s work brings with it not just the general Arthurian associations of Tristram, Iseult and King Mark, but the particular version of these legends presented in Wagner’s <em>Tristan</em>. In fact, by way of a quotation of the so-called ‘Sick Tristan’ motif from the first act of Wagner’s <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>, Bax’s tone poem makes this connection explicit. </p>
    <p>Hitherto, interpretative criticism of <em>Tintagel</em> has been of two kinds: pictorial and biographical. At the time of its premiere in 1921,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref10" href='#_ftn10'>[10]</a> and for some decades after, most critics took the composer’s descriptive programme for the work at face value: the music offered ‘a tonal impression of the castle-crowned cliff of […] Tintagel, […] the long distances of the Atlantic’ and the ‘tumult of the sea’, while also suggesting the ‘literary and traditional associations of the scene’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref11" href='#_ftn11'>[11]</a> In the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, however, the emergence of previously unknown biographical details has elicited another interpretation of the work. In September 1917 Cornwall was the location for Bax’s ongoing extramarital affair with Harriet Cohen, a pianist twelve years his junior.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref12" href='#_ftn12'>[12]</a> Bax’s biographer, Lewis Foreman, has proposed that <em>Tintagel</em> constitutes not just a seascape but also a celebration of Bax’s ‘own passion’ at that time.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref13" href='#_ftn13'>[13]</a> This chapter will explore both of these interpretations, hereafter referred to the as the ‘seascape’ reading and the ‘Cohen’ readings, highlighting Wagnerian connections that are relevant to each. I also propose a new, ‘Irish’ reading of <em>Tintagel</em> that links the work with the 1916 Easter Rising, Bax’s contemporaneous pro-Republican poetry and a narrative of regeneration, inherent in the work’s structure. This narrative, I argue, not only suggests connections with a contemporary revolutionary impulse to revive the ideals of an ancient heroic age in a post-1916 Ireland, but also aligns <em>Tintagel</em> with the regenerative impulse of British Wagnerism. Crucial to this reading, then, no less than in the other interpretations of the work, are <em>Tintagel</em>’s Wagnerian connections.</p>
    <p>There is a consensus among Bax scholars that a change in the composer’s relationship with Ireland and Celticism took place around the end of the First World War.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref14" href='#_ftn14'>[14]</a> Aidan Thomson writes that this ‘crucial shift in Bax’s thinking’ was signalled by ‘his rejection of mythology […] as a compositional stimulus in favour of landscapes and seascapes’ of a more general ‘Celtic North’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref15" href='#_ftn15'>[15]</a> <em>Tintagel</em>, then, with its combination of mythology, landscape, and seascape, would seem to be a key work in Bax’s output, standing as it does on the threshold of this shift. But <em>Tintagel</em> is not usually included among the group of coeval works that are thought to be linked to contemporary political and revolutionary events in Ireland. Before contesting this exclusion in the latter part of this chapter, I provide a formal analysis of <em>Tintagel</em> – situating it within the framework of James Hepokoski and Warren Darcy’s Sonata Theory – that serves to underpin my hermeneutic reading of the work. This chapter suggests that Bax’s eventual rejection of mythology, the early signals of which are indicated by <em>Tintagel</em>, was also linked to a break with Wagnerism that was symptomatic of the decline of the British musical Wagnerism at that time more generally. First, I consider how Bax’s Wagnerism may be profitably viewed within an Irish context, and how Wagnerism, along with the often closely associated movement of Theosophy, had an impact both upon Bax and the artistic and nationalist figures with whom he associated in Ireland.</p>
    <h2>6.1 Ireland, Wagnerism, and Theosophy </h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">In addition to Wagner, another major figure in Bax’s development (as a composer and poet) was W. B. Yeats, whose poetry, Bax later claimed, ‘always meant more to [him] than all the music of the centuries’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref16" href='#_ftn16'>[16]</a> His discovery of Yeats proved to be the beginning of a long association with Ireland and Celticism: ‘I came upon W. B. Yeats’s “The Wanderings of Usheen” in 1902, and in a moment the Celt within me stood revealed’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref17" href='#_ftn17'>[17]</a> Between 1902 and the outbreak of the First World War, Bax, who grew up in a mansion in a wealthy London suburb, regularly visited Ireland, especially the west coast, and lived in Dublin between 1911 and 1914. Over these twelve years he became acquainted with various figures associated with the Irish Literary Revival and Irish republicanism, composed music based on Irish themes, and wrote poetry and short stories under the pseudonym Dermot O’Byrne. According to Bax, his early encounters with Yeats and Ireland had the effect of purging his music of the ‘sway of Wagner and Strauss’, causing him to ‘write Irishly using figures and melodies of a definitely Celtic curve’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref18" href='#_ftn18'>[18]</a> While there may be some truth in this, it is not the case that Bax’s involvement with Ireland and with figures associated with the Irish Literary Revival constituted some kind of break with Wagner; quite the contrary.</p>
    <p>Wagnerism did not reach the same heights in Dublin as it did in <em>fin-de-siècle</em> London, and an Irish musical Wagnerism never really got off the ground.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref19" href='#_ftn19'>[19]</a> Nonetheless, Wagner’s influence in literary circles was substantial. Some of those who played a key role in the Irish Literary Revival, such as George Moore and his cousin Edward Martyn, were avid Wagnerites, and Wagner had a lasting effect on other prominent Irish writers, including George Bernard Shaw and James Joyce.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref20" href='#_ftn20'>[20]</a> Stoddard Martin suggests that Wagner’s music dramas appealed to the Irish because of their ‘mystical, pagan and vaguely Catholic’ nature.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref21" href='#_ftn21'>[21]</a> Moreover, Yeats highlighted the fact that three of Wagner’s works – <em>Lohengrin</em>, <em>Tristan</em>, and <em>Parsifal</em> – were based on Celtic myths.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref22" href='#_ftn22'>[22]</a> Unlike some of his contemporaries, Yeats was no fanatical Wagnerian – and no Catholic – but Wagner provided him with a model for the use of myth in art as a vehicle for expressing and promoting a national identity. Yeats wrote in 1898 that the ‘German soul’ could be perceived in Wagner’s mythological dramas, and he felt that ‘Irish Legends’ – ‘more numerous, and as beautiful as the Norse and German legends’ – could be used to the same effect in his own country.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref23" href='#_ftn23'>[23]</a></p>
    <p>Even those writers who did not express any great interest in Wagner, such as Bax’s close friend George Russell (who published under the pseudonym ‘Æ’), shared with Wagner the interest in mythology, which was fundamental to the project of the Revivalists.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref24" href='#_ftn24'>[24]</a> That Bax saw his two interests of Wagner and Ireland as compatible is demonstrated by his early attempts at creating an Irish music drama. Graham Parlett has recently uncovered evidence to suggest that Bax was working on ‘an Irish Opera’, based on the legend of <em>Grania and Diarmuid</em>, while he was studying at the RAM in around 1902–3.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref25" href='#_ftn25'>[25]</a> It is not difficult to see why this particular legend, which involves a love triangle that parallels that of <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>, appealed to Bax. While this projected Irish opera, along with two subsequent attempts in the genre, never came to fruition,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref26" href='#_ftn26'>[26]</a> these early operatic endeavours demonstrate that Bax’s first forays into a ‘Celtic wonderland’ meant less a break with Wagner than a continuation of his Wagnerism.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref27" href='#_ftn27'>[27]</a></p>
    <p>      Curiously absent from the existing literature on Bax is any consideration of the influence on prominent figures of the Irish Literary Revival, and thus (indirectly) on Bax, of Helena Blavatsky’s brand of Theosophy. The Theosophical Society was established in New York in 1875 by Blavatsky, Henry Olcott, and William Quan Judge (born in Dublin). It offered an eclectic combination of Darwinian ideas about evolution, nineteenth-century science, Buddhist and Hindu theories of reincarnation, and comparative religion. The Dublin Lodge of the Theosophical Society was established in 1886, and over the following years a number of prominent figures of the Revival became involved in the movement, including Yeats and Russell (Æ).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref28" href='#_ftn28'>[28]</a> Blavatsky and her disciples believed that all religions stemmed from one ancient religion or truth that had been corrupted over time.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref29" href='#_ftn29'>[29]</a> Celtic mythology and folklore, especially the knowledge of these legends among the Irish peasantry,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref30" href='#_ftn30'>[30]</a> were considered another descendant of this ancient truth – a branch that had been less tainted by the modern age.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref31" href='#_ftn31'>[31]</a> It is no surprise, then, that many theosophists held the mythological works of Wagner in high esteem.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref32" href='#_ftn32'>[32]</a></p>
    <p>Ken Monteith suggests that ‘the Theosophical Society validated Yeats’s political interests’ by affirming that the Irish were ‘a distinct race’ from the British – in fact, ‘a <em>precedent</em> of the British race’. The Celts, ‘according to theosophists’,</p>
    <blockquote><p>were more in touch with their emotions, more in touch with the spirit world, and embodied a faith which had existed for thousands of years. In contrast, the British were better suited for science, world exploration, and for making trains run on time.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref33" href='#_ftn33'>[33]</a> </p></blockquote>
    <p class="first-para-section">Discussions of Celtic racial characteristics were often presented in explicitly gendered terms in the nineteenth century. Matthew Arnold, in his influential <em>On the Study of Celtic Literature</em> (1867), followed Ernest Renan in characterising the Celts as feminine, sentimental, dreamy, primitive, and anti-materialist.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref34" href='#_ftn34'>[34]</a> By contrast, the English were seen as masculine, politically powerful, and masters of the material world. While some in Ireland reacted against these stereotypes with ‘hyper-masculinity and overt confrontational resistance to Anglo-Saxon domination’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref35" href='#_ftn35'>[35]</a> others made a virtue of the stereotypes and terminology originally used to denigrate the Irish. Typically, this involved claiming that the supposedly primitive and backward characteristics of the Irish meant that they were in closer contact with some ancient wisdom which was superior to the political, materialistic power of countries like England.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref36" href='#_ftn36'>[36]</a> Bax defended the Irish in a similar way, countering Renan’s remark that ‘the Celt has ever worn himself out in mistaking dreams for reality’, by suggesting that ‘the Celt’ knows the difference but ‘deliberately chooses to follow the dream’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref37" href='#_ftn37'>[37]</a> Bax perpetuated the stereotype of Ireland as detached from reality, writing that when he arrived in the country his existence was ‘utterly unrelated to material actualities’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref38" href='#_ftn38'>[38]</a></p>
    <p>      Although Bax never explicitly expressed an interest in Theosophy, he was surrounded by theosophists in Dublin, and some of his short stories and poems which were first published in theosophical journals show the influence of the movement.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref39" href='#_ftn39'>[39]</a> One such story is ‘The Lifting of the Veil’, first published in <em>Orpheus</em>, a theosophical journal edited by Bax’s brother, Clifford.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref40" href='#_ftn40'>[40]</a> The title alone brings to mind Blavatsky’s classic theosophical text, <em>Isis Unveiled</em> (1877).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref41" href='#_ftn41'>[41]</a> The main theme of the story is that of catching glimpses of reality in those fleeting moments in which the ‘veil’ is lifted. As with the noumenal/phenomenal dichotomy of the Schopenhauerian universe of Wagner’s <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>, Blavatsky adopted from Eastern philosophies the idea that the ‘veil of maya’ separates our world of ‘illusion’ from the realm of ‘eternal truth’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref42" href='#_ftn42'>[42]</a> Bax often construed his own world in terms of dreams and reality, no doubt in part due to the combined influence of Wagner, Theosophy, and the portrayal of the Irish as dreamers in the gendered discourse of Celticism. This opposition sometimes manifested itself in his musical works, <em>à la</em> Wagner, as will be demonstrated in the case of <em>Tintagel</em> below.</p>
    <p>      A further theme found in ‘The Lifting of the Veil’ is reincarnation.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref43" href='#_ftn43'>[43]</a> The concept of reincarnation was already familiar to writers like Yeats and Russell from Celtic mythology, so they readily embraced the idea when they encountered it Blavatsky’s Theosophy.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref44" href='#_ftn44'>[44]</a> Intimately tied up with the notion of reincarnation was the theosophical belief in the cyclical nature of history, the idea that both the spiritual and physical worlds move in ‘cycles’. According to Blavatsky, history does not repeat itself exactly in each of these cycles, for each new cycle constitutes some kind of progress towards an ultimate goal. Thus we have a sort of cyclical evolution:</p>
    <blockquote><p>The great kingdoms and empires of the world, after reaching the culmination of their greatness, descend again, in accordance with the same law by which they ascended; till, having reached the lowest point, humanity reasserts itself and mounts up once more, the height of its attainment being, by this law of ascending progression by cycles, somewhat higher than the point from which it had before descended.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref45" href='#_ftn45'>[45]</a></p></blockquote>
    <p class="first-para-section">Parallels (and distinctions) might again be drawn with Wagner and Wagnerism, in particular with the cyclical and regenerative narratives of <em>Parsifal</em> and the <em>Ring</em>, and the many examples of Wagnerian musical works with regeneration narratives composed between 1880 and 1920.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref46" href='#_ftn46'>[46]</a></p>
    <p>Although Bax might not have literally believed in reincarnation or the cyclical progress of history, these ideas evidently had an impact on his literary work and, I argue, his musical work. I aim to demonstrate in the ‘Irish’ reading of <em>Tintagel</em> below that the work presents a simultaneously teleological and cyclical narrative. These sorts of narrative – these musical processes – are, of course, common to many compositions of the period, so there is not necessarily a causal link between the narrative of <em>Tintagel</em> and both the cyclical evolution proposed by Blavatsky and the Wagnerian process of ideal-corruption-redemption (or regeneration) outlined by Aidan Thomson (see the Introduction). Nonetheless, there is a certain compatibility between them, and these correspondences seem pertinent given Bax’s Wagnerian leanings and his immersion in Theosophical ideas in Ireland. </p>
    <h2>6.2 Bax, Pearse, and the Easter Rising</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">While there is no question that Bax aligned his work (literary and musical) with the aesthetic concerns of the Irish Literary Revival, his relationship with Irish politics, particularly with Irish republicanism, is less clear.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref47" href='#_ftn47'>[47]</a> However, while he was living in Dublin, Bax regularly attended the evening gatherings that took place at George Russell’s house, and there he came to know a number of prominent nationalists.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref48" href='#_ftn48'>[48]</a> These included Michael O’Rahilly (‘The O’Rahilly’), Darrell Figgis, James Stephens, Thomas MacDonagh, Padraic Colum, Constance Markievicz (Countess Markievicz), and Patrick Pearse.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref49" href='#_ftn49'>[49]</a> Some of these people were no more than acquaintances of Bax, but he did count Stephens as a friend, and Harriet Cohen described Figgis – a member of the Irish Volunteers and involved in gun-running prior to the Easter Rising – as one of Bax’s ‘closest friends’ whom they saw ‘nearly all the time’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref50" href='#_ftn50'>[50]</a> Moreover, evidence suggests that Bax shared some of the views of his republican friends. In his autobiography, for example, Bax mentions that he ‘hated’ the ‘politics’ of a certain Caroline Blake, a widow who presided over a large estate in Renvyle during the years of the Land War, and who became a ‘heroine of the Unionist cause’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref51" href='#_ftn51'>[51]</a> Perhaps more revealing is that after Bax’s one and only meeting with Patrick Pearse, the latter remarked to Bax’s good friend Molly Colum that ‘I think your friend Arnold Bax may be one of us’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref52" href='#_ftn52'>[52]</a></p>
    <p>Pearse, the schoolteacher, poet, and political revolutionary, clearly illustrates how the artistic and political spheres intersected in early twentieth-century Ireland. Obsessed with the mythical Celtic hero Cúchulainn, with Christ’s crucifixion and with the notion of ‘blood sacrifice’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref53" href='#_ftn53'>[53]</a> he thought that the legend of Cúchulainn was ‘like a retelling […] of the story of Calvary’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref54" href='#_ftn54'>[54]</a> and believed that by sacrificing himself, as he did in 1916, he too could bring about a redemption – for the nation of Ireland.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref55" href='#_ftn55'>[55]</a> Pearse aspired to ‘bring back in Ireland’ a ‘Heroic Age’ and seems to have believed that his redemptive act of blood sacrifice might usher in this revival.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref56" href='#_ftn56'>[56]</a> These hopes for a regenerated Ireland complemented the theosophists’ belief that civilizations move through cycles of progress and decline. In fact, theosophists had predicted that the start of a new historical cycle would begin around the turn of the century, and Yeats and Russell ‘connected this prediction with prophecies of Ireland’s spiritual reawakening’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref57" href='#_ftn57'>[57]</a></p>
    <p>Given that sacrifice and redemption are prominent and recurring themes in Wagner’s works, it is perhaps no surprise that Pearse ‘went to every opera that came to Dublin’, and that, according to his sister, Wagner’s music dramas were his ‘particular favourites’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref58" href='#_ftn58'>[58]</a> In 1904, while studying in Europe, Pearse even made the pilgrimage to Bayreuth where he attended performances of Wagner’s <em>Ring</em> cycle.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref59" href='#_ftn59'>[59]</a> Elaine Sisson has argued that Pearse was impressed with Wagner’s music dramas because they offered a model for the expression of national identity and heroic masculinity, a model that could be used to counter the feminine stereotype of Ireland and the perceived British superiority over the Irish.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref60" href='#_ftn60'>[60]</a> Pearse believed that Cúchulainn was the exemplification of such masculinity, and he no doubt recognized that the Siegfried of Wagner’s <em>Ring</em> represented a similarly masculine hero.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref61" href='#_ftn61'>[61]</a></p>
    <p>Pearse’s attempted revolution and self-sacrifice surely appeared to Bax as events of Wagnerian proportions; like Pearse, Bax aestheticized the violence of the rebels. Private correspondence between Bax and Cohen illustrates the composer’s initial excitement upon hearing of the incipient insurrection in Dublin, and his subsequent sorrow upon learning of Pearse’s death. Though they had apparently met only once, Pearse made a deep impression on the composer. Two days into the Rising Bax wrote to Cohen:</p>
    <blockquote><p>All day my thoughts have been a strange kinship of you and the sudden dramatic Irish rebellion. This has excited me very much. […] I can’t help feeling very strongly about all this. Do you understand? I want to talk to you about Ireland’s recent history someday.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref62" href='#_ftn62'>[62]</a></p></blockquote>
    <p>Less than a year before the Rising, Bax had written that ‘acts of patriotic self-sacrifice’ were a ‘nobl[e]’ manifestation of ‘the vital consciousness of nationality’, and he certainly seems to have regarded Pearse’s actions as those of a martyr.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref63" href='#_ftn63'>[63]</a> He wrote to Cohen after the news came through that Pearse had been executed by a British firing squad:</p>
    <blockquote><p>So poor Pearse was shot yesterday morning. […] He was one of the most whole-hearted idealists that I ever met and I know that all he did was rooted in love – love for Ireland. […] We had a wonderful talk one evening at the Colums about the West and the Gaelic world, all those little intimately and tenderly Irish things that stir the heart’s depths like the little characteristic movements of a beloved one. I shall never forget those who move me in this way, wherever he or she may be or whatever the world’s verdict on them. These days are pretty hideous and only yourself can bring light into them.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref64" href='#_ftn64'>[64]</a></p></blockquote>
    <p>The Easter Rising and Pearse’s execution provoked the most political works that Bax ever produced, taking the form of both poetry and music. Most notably, he wrote an elegiac tone poem, <em>In Memoriam: In Memory of Patrick Pearse</em> (1916), and produced a collection of nine poems, <em>A Dublin Ballad and Other Poems</em> (1918), on the subject of the Easter Rising and subsequent political events in Ireland.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref65" href='#_ftn65'>[65]</a> Bax composed a number of other musical works during this time that are clearly related to the momentous happenings in Ireland, or that otherwise seem to contain a ‘hidden “in memoriam” programme’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref66" href='#_ftn66'>[66]</a> These include another work with the title <em>In Memoriam</em> (1917), an <em>Elegiac Trio</em> (1916), the song <em>A Leader</em> (1916), the <em>Symphonic Variations</em> for piano and orchestra (1917),&#8288;<a id="_ftnref67" href='#_ftn67'>[67]</a> and the <em>Phantasy</em> for viola and orchestra (1920).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref68" href='#_ftn68'>[68]</a> <em>Tintagel</em>, I contend, could be included among this group of works, but first I offer a formal analysis of the work and consider the two existing interpretations of Bax’s tone poem: the ‘seascape’ reading and the ‘Cohen’ reading.</p>
    <h2>6.3 <em>Tintagel</em>: Form and Interpretation</h2>
    <h3>6.3.1 The ‘Seascape’ Reading and a Formal Analysis</h3>
    <p class="first-para-section">Bax claimed in his extended programme note for <em>Tintagel</em> that the piece offered only a vague ‘impression’ of Tintagel Castle and the sea, but his subsequent description suggested some direct analogies between physical phenomena and musical events:</p>
    <blockquote><p>The composer’s intention is simply to offer a tonal impression of the castle-crowned cliff of (now sadly degenerate) Tintagel, and more especially of the long distances of the Atlantic, as seen from the cliffs of Cornwall on a sunny, but not windless, summer day. The literary and traditional associations of the scene also enter into the scheme. The music opens, after a few introductory bars, with a theme, given out by brass, which may be taken as representing the ruined castle, now so ancient and weatherworn as to seem an emanation of the rock upon which it is built. The subject is worked to a broad diatonic climax, and is followed by a long melody for strings, which may suggest the serene and almost limitless spaces of the ocean. After a while a more restless mood begins to assert itself, as though the sea were rising, bringing with it a new sense of stress, thoughts of many passionate and tragic incidents in the tales of King Arthur and King Mark and others among the men and women of their time.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref69" href='#_ftn69'>[69]</a> A wailing chromatic figure is heard, and gradually dominates the music until finally it assumes a shape which recalls to mind one of the subjects of the first Act of ‘Tristan and Isolda’ (whose fate was, of course, intimately connected with Tintagel). Here occurs a motif which may be taken as representing the increasing tumult of the sea. Soon after there is a great climax, suddenly subsiding, followed by a passage which will perhaps convey the impression of immense waves slowly gathering force until they smash themselves upon the impregnable rocks. The theme of the sea is heard again, and the piece ends as it began, with a picture of the castle still proudly fronting the sun and wind of centuries.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref70" href='#_ftn70'>[70]</a></p></blockquote>
    <p>Hitherto, all discussions of <em>Tintagel</em> have considered the work to be in some kind of ternary form,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref71" href='#_ftn71'>[71]</a> but it might more profitably be viewed in terms of what James Hepokoski and Warren Darcy refer to as a ‘sonata deformation’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref72" href='#_ftn72'>[72]</a> Following Hepokoski and Darcy’s premiss that sonata form is ‘essentially <em>dialogic</em>, not conformational’, I suggest that the work can be interpreted as being in dialogue with ‘a set of implied norms […] which the reception community is assumed to share’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref73" href='#_ftn73'>[73]</a> As Hepokoski points out in his examination of Strauss’s <em>Till Eulenspiegel</em>, single-movement tone poems ‘had derived historically from the opera and concert overture’, a genre which ‘most commonly laid out a sonata form or a deformation thereof’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref74" href='#_ftn74'>[74]</a> This fact, along with ‘crucially placed signals of [sonata form] provided in the work’, would lead a ‘text-adequate listener or musical insider of 1895’ to expect and to hear a work in ‘a cleverly charged dialogue’ with sonata form proper.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref75" href='#_ftn75'>[75]</a> A ‘text-adequate listener’ at the premiere of <em>Tintagel</em> in 1921 would likely have had similar expectations of a tone-poem stemming from the Straussian tradition.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref76" href='#_ftn76'>[76]</a></p>
    <p>While the forms of Bax’s earlier tone poems, such as <em>In the Faery Hills</em>, were usually closer to ternary than sonata form, his approach to form is more complex in his later works, <em>The Garden of Fand</em> (1914–16), <em>November Woods</em>, and <em>Tintagel</em>. More insightful are Anthony Payne’s remarks on Bax’s ‘sprawling symphonic-poem design’: a ‘mixture of ternary and sonata form’ that can be ‘found in the <em>Garden of Fand</em>, <em>November Woods</em>, and the opening movements of the Second, Third and Fifth Symphonies’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref77" href='#_ftn77'>[77]</a> Compared with the somewhat episodic <em>Fand</em>, <em>November Woods</em> is more clearly in dialogue with sonata form, as suggested in particular by the move to the dominant key for a lyrical second theme, and the return of this theme in the tonic major towards the end of the work. Thus, in part because of the general expectations of the tone poem genre, and in part because Bax’s own most recent tone poems were becoming increasingly sonata-like, an informed and attentive audience at the premiere and subsequent performances of <em>Tintagel</em> in the early 1920s would, above all, expect that the work ask its listeners to hear it against a background of sonata-form norms. As the music of <em>Tintagel</em> unfolds as a ‘<em>temporal</em> process of ongoing dialogue’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref78" href='#_ftn78'>[78]</a> there are a number of ‘crucially placed signals’ that affirm the sonata-form concept’s relevance to the work. Equally, there are aspects that challenge it, but this is typical of sonata deformations and of the compositional practice of the era. In fact, it is these deviations from the norm that provide us with a ‘hermeneutic opportunity’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref79" href='#_ftn79'>[79]</a></p>
    <p>Table 1 provides an interpretation of <em>Tintagel</em> as a sonata deformation, and shows how the music corresponds with Bax’s programme. The ruins of Tintagel Castle are first suggested by the music of bars 7–9, which bear a resemblance, in terms of their general melodic contour, rhythmic pattern, and sonority, to Wagner’s ‘Valhalla’ motif from the <em>Ring</em> cycle. &#8288;<a id="_ftnref80" href='#_ftn80'>[80]</a> After what prove to be twelve introductory bars, which introduce a distinctive (and Debussyan) ostinato accompanimental figure in the violins, we hear a strong ‘masculine’ theme in the brass (Ex. 6.1). Ostensibly representing the castle, this music has all the rhetoric of a sonata-form primary theme, setting in motion the work’s dialogue with a set of background sonata-form norms. This B major theme, organized internally as a sentence, culminates with what Bax describes as the ‘broad diatonic climax’ (in B major) at bar 27.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref81" href='#_ftn81'>[81]</a> Though not underpinned by a perfect authentic cadence (PAC), this moment may be heard as articulating the end of the primary-theme zone.</p>
    <p>The next theme (Ex. 6.2), described by Bax as depicting ‘the serene and almost limitless spaces of the ocean’, does not begin in a new key area, but rather remains in the tonic key of B major. This presents a challenge to the sonata-form concept: one of the fundamental principles of Hepokoski and Darcy’s Sonata Theory is that the exposition must ‘move to and cadence in a secondary key’. This cadence, conventionally a PAC, marks the point of the ‘‘essential expositional closure’ (EEC).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref82" href='#_ftn82'>[82]</a> While there is a brief tonicisation of the subdominant, E major, at bar 43, the music soon shifts back to the tonic, B major. What may still be heard as the secondary-theme zone (for reasons explained below) concludes with a modified imperfect authentic cadence (IAC) in that key at bars 54–5 (Ex. 6.3), which may be taken to constitute the EEC.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref83" href='#_ftn83'>[83]</a></p>

    <p>The fact that the EEC is not in a nontonic key in <em>Tintagel</em> might cause one to question the relevance of Sonata Theory to the work at all. Rhetorically, however, the theme beginning at bar 34 quite clearly invites interpretation as a sonata-form secondary theme. This theme fits into Hepokoski and Darcy’s category of the ‘Lyrically “Singing” or Gracefully <em>Cantabile</em> S’, and its contrast with the primary theme creates a typically nineteenth-century gendered opposition between the two themes: ‘the idea of a masculine P […] counterposed to a feminine (or otherwise eroticized or idealized) S’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref84" href='#_ftn84'>[84]</a> Hepokoski identifies Wagner’s Overture to <em>Der Fliegende Holländer</em> as a <em>locus classicus</em> of a particular type of sonata form that involves this gendered opposition of themes, and which is characterized by a number of other features that are also present in <em>Tintagel</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref85" href='#_ftn85'>[85]</a> These include an exposition made up of two contrasting ‘blocks’, joined by ‘only the briefest […] of connective material’ (the primary- and secondary-theme zones in <em>Tintagel</em> joined by the six bars of caesura fill), and a secondary theme which returns in the recapitulation ‘in a grand, <em>fortissimo</em> apotheosis, as the climax and <em>telos</em> of the piece’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref86" href='#_ftn86'>[86]</a> This ‘Dutchman type’ of form, as Hepokoski refers to it, often contains a ‘built-in struggle-to-victory trajectory’ that was common to many nineteenth-century symphonic works.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref87" href='#_ftn87'>[87]</a></p>
    <p>The ‘restless mood’ that Bax mentions in his programme may be considered to begin during bars 56–67 (particularly from b. 64). Since these bars come after the essential expositional closure but before the start of the development, they are best viewed in terms of Sonata Theory as part of a closing zone. Although their function seems to be mostly interludial, this music does reaffirm the key of the EEC (in this case the tonic) – as closing zones normatively do – in bar 63 with another modified IAC (a minor chord v moving to I). One might argue, however, that the restless mood really begins within the secondary-theme zone at bar 45, where Wagnerian chromaticism creeps in for the first time (Ex. 6.4).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref88" href='#_ftn88'>[88]</a> The descending chromatic motion at bars 45–6 – particularly in the bass line and the inner parts – anticipates the ‘Sick Tristan’ motif that permeates the development, and there is even an allusion to the opening of the <em>Tristan</em> Prelude in bars 463–82.</p>

    <p>The appearance of the secondary theme at bar 68, now in bVI (G major) and accompanied by fragments (in the flutes) of the ostinato arpeggio figures that were earlier heard in the violins in the introduction and with the primary theme, provides a strong signal that we have entered the ‘developmental space’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref89" href='#_ftn89'>[89]</a> Another statement of this theme between bars 80–4, this time in i (B minor) and accompanied more clearly now by the ostinato figure from the introduction, further reinforces the sense that this is the beginning of the development. Moreover, the music between bars 68–84 could be considered to function as one of the four normative types of developmental ‘zones’ posited by Hepokoski and Darcy: an ‘<em>entry or preparation zone</em>’, which is followed by the next normative zone, ‘the central action-space’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref90" href='#_ftn90'>[90]</a> The sense of ‘entry or preparation’ stems from the largely <em>piano</em> dynamic level in this section and the still, static mood engendered by the sustained pedal notes and chords accompanying the occurrences of the secondary theme.</p>
    <p>The music between the two developmental statements of the secondary theme introduces two chromatic motifs which dominate the remainder of the developmental space: the ‘Sick Tristan’ motif and a one-bar motif I have labelled ‘Conflict’, for reasons outlined below. As Bax stated in his programme, the ‘Sick Tristan’ motif is found (predominantly) in Act I of <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>, specifically during Isolde’s narrative, in which she recalls events that took place before the start of the drama.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref91" href='#_ftn91'>[91]</a> In <em>Tristan</em> the motif is found in two forms, which Alfred Lorenz labelled as ‘Stormy’ and ‘Mild’ (see Exx. 6.5a and 6.5b).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref92" href='#_ftn92'>[92]</a> Bax’s initial use of the motif (Ex. 6.6) retains the characteristic descending chromatic motion and dotted rhythm of Wagner’s, but its harmonisation is markedly different. In <em>Tristan</em> the motif tends to lead to a cadence – interrupted, perfect, or half. By contrast, in Ex. 6 the parallel chromatic motion of the half-diminished seventh chords, above an E pedal, create a sense of tonal ambiguity. Although in vertical isolation these half-diminished seventh chords reinforce the <em>Tristan</em> connection, considered horizontally this music has more in common with Debussy than Wagner.</p>

    <p>Debussy’s influence is apparent in other parts of the work as well. The brass fanfares and accompanying swirling string figures of the primary theme in <em>Tintagel</em> clearly owe something to both the end of the first movement, and the music between figures 49 and 51 of the third movement, of Debussy’s <em>La Mer</em>. Moreover, the third movement of <em>La Mer</em>, a depiction of an ‘animated and tumultuous’ wind and sea, also alludes to Wagner’s ‘Sick Tristan’ motif (particularly apparent just after fig. 51). Given the prominence of the sea in <em>Tristan</em>, especially in the first act, it follows that Debussy and Bax alluded to this particular motif in works associated with the sea.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref93" href='#_ftn93'>[93]</a> By the time he composed <em>Tintagel</em>, sea music had already become something of a recurring ‘topic’ in Bax’s music, one that Derrick Puffett suggests first appeared in the song ‘At Last’ from the 1904 <em>Celtic Song Cycle</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref94" href='#_ftn94'>[94]</a> Puffett describes the sea music in <em>The Garden of Fand</em>, along with its themes of ‘revelry’ and ‘amorous song’, as ‘types’ (I use the term ‘topic’ instead), and suggests that when these topics reappear in later works ‘we remember not just the work [<em>Fand</em>] but the programme that goes with it’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref95" href='#_ftn95'>[95]</a> Puffett continues: ‘<em>Fand</em> can thus be used to interpret the later work’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref96" href='#_ftn96'>[96]</a></p>
    <p>The tempo and textural change at bar 154 signals that the music has left the central action-space of the development and entered a new phase. Initially, at least, the function of this new section is formally ambiguous, the music suggesting both a return (recapitulation) and further development. The music between bars 154–189 consists of two parallel eighteen-bar sections. The first begins with a new ostinato figure in the flutes, which, though much darker than the ostinato that accompanies the primary theme in the exposition, suggests a parallel with the opening of the piece. The primary theme is soon heard in E♭ minor above a sustained pedal C, creating a half-diminished (Tristan) chord effect. This is followed by a crescendo culminating with a fortissimo 6/4 F major chord at bar 168, described in Bax’s programme as the ‘great climax, suddenly subsiding’. The second eighteen-bar section follows the same pattern: first there is the primary theme, now in A♭ minor and above a C♭/B pedal, then a crescendo and climax at bar 186 – the moment described by Bax as the waves ‘smash[ing] themselves upon the impregnable rocks’. In some respects, this music still sounds developmental: there are two intensification-drives, achieved in part by the urgent rising semiquavers just before each climax which recall bars 136–7 of the development. This section might, then, initially be heard as functioning as the last normative developmental zone identified by Hepokoski and Darcy: ‘the <em>exit</em> or <em>retransition</em>’. While there is no conventional ‘structural-dominant lock’ here to prepare for the recapitulation and the home key, there is certainly a sense of striving to get back, reinforced by the intensifying wave imagery of Bax’s programmatic description and the pedal note in the bass that moves down from C to C♭, which then turns into a B, heightening the sense of imminent return to the home key.</p>
    <p>Following the second climactic crash of waves, the secondary theme returns, as does the home key of B major (though initially over a dominant pedal).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref97" href='#_ftn97'>[97]</a> The bypassing of a tonic recapitulation of the primary theme, skipping straight to the secondary theme, may cause a retrospective reinterpretation of the ‘retransition’ as a nontonic beginning of a recapitulatory rotation.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref98" href='#_ftn98'>[98]</a> The return of the secondary theme (‘the theme of the sea is heard again’), now transformed into a fortissimo orchestral tutti, constitutes the climax of the entire piece and the moment – the <em>telos</em> – that the whole development and start of the recapitulation have been working towards (the hermeneutic implications of this crucial moment in the work are considered in more detail below).</p>
    <p>The secondary theme soon merges into a new statement of the primary theme at bar 198, now returned to its expositional grandeur, though beginning in the subdominant key of E major.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref99" href='#_ftn99'>[99]</a> Initially, this may be heard as a ‘rotational restart’ that ushers in a coda,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref100" href='#_ftn100'>[100]</a> but by the <em>Molto Largamente</em> at bar 210, the primary theme has run its course, and the recapitulatory rotation resumes – and concludes – with a transformed version of the music from the exposition’s closing zone (bb. 210–17 roughly parallel bb. 56–63). </p>
    <p>Although B major is clearly established during the secondary theme and is once again reached at the first chord of bar 210, there is no clear IAC or PAC in that key, and thus no obvious point of ‘essential structural closure’. Bars 209–10 could be considered a ‘“modern” substitute’ for a PAC,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref101" href='#_ftn101'>[101]</a> but the strength of the resolution there is immediately undermined by the chromatic descent in some of the parts, leading to an F# minor chord over a B pedal. As the recapitulation fails to achieve the essential structural closure, it may be considered an example of what Hepokoski has termed the ‘nonresolving recapitulation’ – another common sonata deformation found in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century works.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref102" href='#_ftn102'>[102]</a> It is, however, a mild form of this deformation; the tonic key is clearly apparent in the recapitulation, but it is not secured by way of a I:PAC or a satisfactory alternative. Hepokoski notes that such recapitulations create ‘a sense of unease, alienation, futility, recapitulatory failure, or the like’, but the resolution, ‘though dramatically delayed, is normally accomplished […] in a special coda space’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref103" href='#_ftn103'>[103]</a> In <em>Tintagel</em>, a resolution is indeed achieved in the short coda, with the V–I motion at bars 227–8 – ‘the piece ends as it began, with a picture of the castle still proudly fronting the sun and wind of centuries’.</p>
    <p>While the seascape narrative of <em>Tintagel</em> provided by Bax accounts for much of the music, certain aspects of the work, such as the tonal unity of the exposition, the nontonic opening of the recapitulation, and the disruptive intrusion of the ‘Sick Tristan’ music immediately before the closing bars of the coda, invite further hermeneutic interpretation. The ‘Irish’ reading of <em>Tintagel</em> set out below will offer an interpretation of these deformational and remarkable aspects of the work. First, however, it is worth considering the ‘Cohen’ reading in a little more detail than it has been up till now, particularly as it intersects in significant ways with both the ‘seascape’ and ‘Irish’ readings of <em>Tintagel</em> described here.</p>
    <h3>6.3.2 The ‘Cohen’ Reading</h3>
    <p class="first-para-section">Fundamental to the ‘Cohen’ reading is the work’s connections with the legend of Tristan and Iseult and Wagner’s <em>Tristan</em>. In this reading of <em>Tintagel</em>, Bax alluded to Wagner’s through the ‘Sick Tristan’ motif drama because he saw parallels between the love story of <em>Tristan und Isolde</em> and his own love affair with Cohen. That Bax saw his relationship with Cohen through a Wagnerian or <em>Tristan</em>-esque lens is demonstrated by some of his correspondence with Cohen and by a poem he wrote shortly before composing <em>Tintagel</em>, named ‘Tintagel Castle’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref104" href='#_ftn104'>[104]</a> The poem, told from the perspective of two modern-day lovers, refers to the legend of ‘Tristram and Iseult’ and highlights the universality of their love story: ‘We have a certain token / How hearts of old were broken; / And English, Celt or Norman, / Love hurt them still the same’. The third stanza refers to ‘the dream their world denied’: their true love which is prohibited by the laws and conventions of society. Bax expressed a similar sentiment in a letter to Cohen, dating from 1 September 1917:</p>
    <blockquote><p>I don’t care what the mean dirty world says or does to me as long as you love me and I can help you at all[.] The world will always revel in taking the basest view of the relationships of men and women.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref105" href='#_ftn105'>[105]</a></p></blockquote>
    <p>In both the poem and the letter, Bax presents love in a distinctly Wagnerian fashion; the natural law of love is cast in opposition to the unnatural laws of society.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref106" href='#_ftn106'>[106]</a> Bax aligns his own circumstances with those found in <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>, in which the principal characters’ real, forbidden love contrasts with the planned forced marriage between Isolde and King Marke.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref107" href='#_ftn107'>[107]</a></p>
    <p>The reference to ‘the dream’ denied by the ‘world’ in Bax’s poem suggests not only the Wagnerian opposition between love and law, but also the dreams/reality dichotomy within which Bax often framed his own life and experiences. Cohen, whom Bax first met in the mountains south of Dublin – something of a mystical place for Bax – was very much a part of his dream-world.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref108" href='#_ftn108'>[108]</a> As noted above, Bax would have encountered the theme of division between everyday reality and some higher realm in Celtic mythology and Theosophy, but it was perhaps in Wagner’s <em>Tristan</em> where he first came into contact with such ideas. In Act II of <em>Tristan</em>, Wagner uses the symbolism of ‘day’ and ‘night’ to represent, on the one hand, Schopenhauer’s phenomenal world of appearances, and, on the other hand, the noumenal world-in-itself, in which the lovers can literally become one.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref109" href='#_ftn109'>[109]</a> Bryan Magee observes that all three acts begin with sounds from the external, phenomenal world (represented by ‘day’ in Act II). As each act progresses, however, it becomes more focussed on Tristan and Isolde’s inner world (represented by the ‘night’ in Act II). At the end of the first two acts, however, ‘the external world comes crashing in […] to catastrophic effect’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref110" href='#_ftn110'>[110]</a> In Act I, for example, Tristan and Isolde’s inner dialogue is interrupted by the shouts of the sailors and their ship’s arrival in Cornwall. In this case, the opposition between the inner and outer worlds is also represented by the use of mainly chromatic music in Tristan and Isolde’s inner dialogue, and diatonic music, like the C major at the end of the Act, to represent the external world of the sailors and the cliffs of Cornwall.</p>
    <p>      In <em>Tintagel</em> there is a similar sense of an inner world framed by an outer one. The largely diatonic music of the exposition and recapitulation, perhaps representative of an external world – the sea and the castle – encapsulates the chromatic inner world of the development. The music of the development, then, might symbolize Bax’s personal emotions at the time of his affair,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref111" href='#_ftn111'>[111]</a> and the conflict between a sense of ‘domestic responsibility’ and his feelings of illicit sexual desire towards Cohen.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref112" href='#_ftn112'>[112]</a> Both at the end of <em>Tristan</em>’s first act and at the climactic recapitulatory statement of the secondary theme in <em>Tintagel</em>, it is Tintagel Castle, the cliffs of Cornwall, and the sea that burst in and sweep the inner world away. </p>
    <p>      As Christopher Palmer has observed, for Wagner, Debussy, Delius, and Bax (all of whom alluded to the ‘Sick Tristan’ motif in their works), the sea was symbolically linked to ‘feelings of sexual desire and passion’. Palmer notes that this association is particularly ‘explicit’ in Bax’s <em>The Garden of Fand</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref113" href='#_ftn113'>[113]</a> Given Puffett’s suggestion that <em>Fand</em> can be used to interpret later works that contain the same musical topics (such as sea music),&#8288;<a id="_ftnref114" href='#_ftn114'>[114]</a> it is significant that <em>Fand</em> is also structured in such a way as to suggest a dream-world framed by an external world. According to Bax’s programme for the work (printed at the beginning of the score), it begins, like <em>Tintagel</em>, with a depiction of the Atlantic Ocean. Sailing on the ocean is a small ship which is soon thrown by a huge wave ‘on to the shore of Fand’s miraculous island’, the Celtic ‘Otherworld’:</p>
    <blockquote><p>Here is unhuman revelry unceasing between the ends of time, and the voyagers [from the ship] are caught away, unresisting, into the maze of the dance. A pause comes, and Fand sings her song of immortal love, enchaining the hearts of her hearers forever. The dancing and the feasting begin again, and, finally, the sea rising suddenly overwhelms the whole island, the immortals riding in rapture on the green and golden waves, and laughing carelessly amidst the foam at the fate of the over-rash mortals lost in the depths. Twilight falls, the sea subsides, and Fand’s garden fades out of sight.</p></blockquote>
    <p>The programme thus outlines a story that involves leaving the real world, entering a dream-world, and finally returning to the real world. This is reflected in the work’s ABCBA structure: the B sections represent the unceasing revelry; C is Fand’s song of immortal love; and the A sections, framing the orgiastic central episodes, depict the Atlantic Ocean. The central developmental space of <em>Tintagel</em>, then, might also be interpreted as a visit to the Otherworld, or rather some kind of <em>other world</em>, with all its sexual associations.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref115" href='#_ftn115'>[115]</a></p>
    <p>      This <em>Tristan</em>-esque dream-framed-by-reality interpretation of <em>Tintagel</em> is problematic, however. Bax regarded ‘dreams’, as he regarded Cohen, as an escape from the harsh realities of a material world. The developmental space of <em>Tintagel</em>, however, is more like a nightmare than a dream, and the outer sections suggest less a harsh reality than an ideal realm. One might be tempted, then, to invert the reading outlined above. Now, the chromatic music of the development is the harsh reality (Bax’s ‘mental turmoil’)&#8288;<a id="_ftnref116" href='#_ftn116'>[116]</a> intruding upon the dream-world, represented by the diatonic themes of the exposition and recapitulation. The ‘Sick Tristan’ motif signifies Bax, the wounded hero, striving to overcome adversity. This he eventually achieves at the apotheosis of the secondary theme, representing in this reading the triumph of the dream and of his love for Cohen.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref117" href='#_ftn117'>[117]</a> It is no coincidence that Bax chose the key of B major for <em>Tintagel</em>, the same key used to depict Tristan and Isolde’s blissful dissolution into the oneness of the noumenal realm at the end of <em>Tristan</em>. However, this reading, too, is problematic. While the recapitulation of the secondary theme provides a release of tension and a return to B major, the resolution is undermined, to some extent, by the F# dominant pedal that underpins it.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref118" href='#_ftn118'>[118]</a> This, along with the recapitulation’s ‘failure’ to achieve the essential structural closure, the loss of momentum at the end of the recapitulation and in the coda, and, above all, the eerie return of the ‘Sick Tristan’ motif at bars 220–3, seems to question the triumph of the secondary theme’s recapitulation.</p>
    <p>In <em>Unsung Voices</em> Carolyn Abbate argues that ‘to see how music might narrate […] we must see how it does <em>not</em> enact actions from a non-musical world, but is instead non-congruent with that world in retelling it’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref119" href='#_ftn119'>[119]</a> The four bars just mentioned are certainly non-congruent with Bax’s seascape narrative, which suggests that the end of the piece simply returns to a serene picture of the castle and the sea. Abbate also proposes that a narrative voice in music often seems as though it is ‘speaking from elsewhere’ and has a ‘bizarre and disruptive effect’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref120" href='#_ftn120'>[120]</a> The appearance of the ‘Sick Tristan’ motif in the coda, especially the second statement of it in bars 222–3, is surely a moment that meets all of these criteria. This music is certainly disruptive; it interrupts the sense of a return to stability created by the S<sup>1.0</sup> figure, and it stands out at this point of the piece because the motif is otherwise entirely confined to the developmental space (as is most of the chromatic music).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref121" href='#_ftn121'>[121]</a> The orchestration of these two bars is also distinctive; the other-worldly sound created by the tremolo strings, the murky clarinets, bass clarinet, and bassoons, and the sighing figure (a modified version of the ‘Sick Tristan’ motif) in the cellos and cor anglais, occurs nowhere else in the work. For Abbate, moments like this are unique because, despite sensing a narrative mode, ‘we do not know <em>what</em> it narrates’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref122" href='#_ftn122'>[122]</a> Nonetheless, we can speculate as to what the meaning of this distinctive utterance might be. Looking beyond Bax’s love life helps to elucidate what this uncanny voice could be narrating.</p>
    <h3>6.3.3 An ‘Irish’ Reading</h3>
    <p class="first-para-section"><em>Tintagel</em> is undoubtedly a Celtic work. Even before the Second World War it was described by some critics as a ‘Cornish-Celtic tone-poem’, and Puffett has argued that all works after <em>Fand</em> containing any one of its topics of revelry, amorous song, or the sea are given, ‘by association, an authentically Celtic stamp’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref123" href='#_ftn123'>[123]</a> Bax himself was interested in Tintagel because of its Celtic associations: in a letter to Cohen from 11 September 1917, he wrote of the ‘old old Celtic mood that this forgotten bit of Cornwall has kept through the ages’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref124" href='#_ftn124'>[124]</a> As Bax understood it, Cornwall represented the same kind of relic of an ideal Celtic ancient past as Ireland, a dream-world into which he could escape from the materialistic reality of modern-day England. <em>Tintagel</em>, then, might be considered not only a Celtic work but an Irish work.</p>
    <p>      Although <em>Tintagel</em> was composed over a year after the Easter Rising, Bax was still preoccupied with Irish politics in 1917. This is evidenced by two of the poems that form part of his collection <em>A Dublin Ballad and Other Poems</em> (1918): ‘The East Clare Election: 1917’ and ‘The East Clare Election: 1828–1917’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref125" href='#_ftn125'>[125]</a> Just three months before Bax composed <em>Tintagel</em>, Eamon de Valera, the only leader of the Easter rebels not to be executed, stood as Sinn Féin’s candidate in the East Clare by-election and won, beating the more moderate Irish Parliamentary Party’s candidate, Patrick Lynch.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref126" href='#_ftn126'>[126]</a> Bax’s two poems on this subject certainly suggest that he looked favourably upon the growing support for Sinn Féin, who would go on to win a landslide victory in the 1918 general election.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref127" href='#_ftn127'>[127]</a> In the first line of the second poem, for example, the result of the by-election is described as a ‘day of victory’. In both poems, Bax seems to express hope that there might be a new Irish Republic on the horizon, writing of ‘the Ireland that is to be’ and ‘an Ireland built anew’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref128" href='#_ftn128'>[128]</a></p>
    <p>The additional date in the title of the second poem – 1828 – refers to another by-election which took place in Clare, which saw the victory of Daniel O’Connell, referred to as ‘Old Dan’ in Bax’s poem. O’Connell founded the Catholic Association in 1823, an organisation which campaigned for Catholic Emancipation. One of the aims of the Association was to earn Catholics the right to sit in parliament at Westminster. Thanks in large part to O’Connell and his victory in the Clare by-election, this goal was achieved with the passing of the Catholic Relief Act in 1829.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref129" href='#_ftn129'>[129]</a> Although generally regarded as an Irish hero and often referred to as ‘The Liberator’, Bax’s poem criticizes O’Connell for not going far enough in his attempt to free Ireland from its English oppressors. The third stanza states that ‘Old Dan’ ‘drove our minds from Cruachan’, a fortress in Connacht, known in Celtic mythology as the home of Queen Medb,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref130" href='#_ftn130'>[130]</a> ‘To the dark House of Lies on Thames’ (the Houses of Parliament). The meaning (to be inferred from the poem) would seem to be that rather than diverting the Irish people’s attention towards London, O’Connell should have been focussing on bringing about an Irish state completely independent from British rule. In contrast to O’Connell’s ‘abhorrence of violence’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref131" href='#_ftn131'>[131]</a> Bax’s poetry seems to espouse the kind of blood-drenched revolution attempted by Pearse and the other rebels of 1916.</p>
    <p>Considering that Bax’s poetry from this time was so explicitly concerned with Ireland, it does not seem unreasonable to identify an implicit Irish programme in <em>Tintagel</em>. This is not to say that Bax necessarily intended such a programme, though that is not implausible. The case for considering <em>Tintagel</em> an Irish work is further supported by the distinctly Irish connotations of both the secondary theme and the ‘Sick Tristan’ motif. Hitherto, little consideration has been given to the context in which the ‘Sick Tristan’ motif originally appears in <em>Tristan</em>, nor what this entails for an interpretation of Bax’s seascape. As noted above, the ‘Sick Tristan’ motif permeates Isolde’s narrative in Act I, in which she tells of the events leading up to the start of the drama: Tristan, ‘a sick and ailing man […] dying in misery’, arrives on Ireland’s shore, disguised as ‘Tantris’. Isolde, an Irish princess with ‘healing ointments and soothing lotions’, tends to his wounds. Isolde soon realizes Tristan’s true identity: he is the man who killed her fiancée, the Irish knight Morold. She ‘stood ready to take revenge on [Tristan] for Sir Morold’s death’, but when their eyes meet she is unable to do so. Instead, she permits him to leave, on the condition that he never return to Ireland. Tristan, however, breaks his promise: ‘he brazenly returned as Tristan […] to claim the Irish heiress as a bride for Cornwall’s weary king – for Marke, his uncle’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref132" href='#_ftn132'>[132]</a></p>
    <p>Whether or not Bax recognized the motif’s Irish connections, we cannot know for sure. It may be a coincidence that the only place in the first act of <em>Tristan</em> where a version of the motif begins on an F# – as it does when it is first stated in <em>Tintagel</em> (Ex. 6.6) – occurs exactly on the word ‘Irenland’ (Ex. 6.7). This statement of the motif comes at the climax of Isolde’s narrative, just before the curse, when she is imitating what Tristan might have said to King Marke upon his return to Cornwall: ‘I’ll hasten to Ireland and Isolde shall be yours!’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref133" href='#_ftn133'>[133]</a> Not only, then, is the ‘Sick Tristan’ motif associated with Ireland, but it is linked to the conflict between the people of Ireland and Cornwall. Many of the events recounted in Isolde’s narrative are concerned with Cornwall’s dominance and exertion of power over Ireland. Although in <em>Tristan</em> the Cornish are a Celtic people, Bax might well have perceived some parallels between the oppression of the Irish by the Cornish Celts in Wagner’s music drama and the oppression of the Irish by the English in the early twentieth century. In both the mythological events of <em>Tristan</em> and the real-life events of 1916, Ireland is subjugated to the position of England’s feminine ‘Other’.</p>

    </div>

    <p>It is significant that Isolde, the character representative of Ireland in <em>Tristan</em>, is female. As noted above, Ireland and the Irish were often characterized by the English as dreamy and feminine in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and Bax bought into these stereotypes. Ireland and Cohen were closely associated in Bax’s mind; both represented a world of escapist fantasy. Ireland was the place where Bax’s ‘dream became localized’, and he wrote that while living there he ‘was in love with Ireland and for the while needed no mortal mistress’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref134" href='#_ftn134'>[134]</a> When Bax wrote to Cohen in Easter Week 1916, he described her as ‘the symbol of Ireland’:</p>
    <blockquote><p>I suppose because the quality of my feelings for both of you is rather similar, for Ireland always was to me a living breathing spirit. I can feel her heart beating when I lie on her hill-sides – like a woman’s heart but more tender and noble than that of most of the world’s women.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref135" href='#_ftn135'>[135]</a></p></blockquote>
    <p>Taking into account Bax’s decidedly feminine portrayal of Ireland, the ‘feminine’ secondary theme of <em>Tintagel</em>’s ‘gendered two-block exposition’ might be considered representative not just of the sea or love, but also of Ireland. The Irishness of the theme is suggested by other characteristics as well. In fact, this theme might be considered an example of another recurring topic in Bax’s music: the ‘Irish tune’. This typically (though not invariably) takes the form of a broad, lyrical diatonic melody with strong pentatonic inflections played by strings. This topic can be traced back to the opening melody of Bax’s tone poem <em>Cathaleen-ni-Hoolihan</em> (1903–5).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref136" href='#_ftn136'>[136]</a> The secondary theme of <em>Tintagel</em> quite clearly belongs to this category. Its quasi-pentatonicism, in particular, identifies it as an instance of the ‘Irish tune’, not least because Bax himself described the use of the pentatonic scale as ‘peculiar to Irish folk music’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref137" href='#_ftn137'>[137]</a> The fact that the main theme of the orchestral <em>In Memoriam</em>, composed just a year earlier, is also a B major ‘Irish tune’ suggests some potential intertextual connection between this work and <em>Tintagel</em>, thus reinforcing the Irish, and specifically the Easter Rising, connection.</p>
    <p>If we accept that the secondary theme is symbolic of Ireland, this has profound implications for the interpretation of the whole work. Now the tonal unity of the exposition could be interpreted as a picture of an ideal Ireland, a prelapsarian dream-world unsullied by ‘reality’. In this reading, the primary theme suggests not the ruins of Tintagel Castle but the Castle in all its glory during an earlier era, symbolic of a golden Celtic age in Ireland. The first intrusion of the chromatic music at bar 45 signals the beginning of the corruption of the ideal established in the preceding bars. The two statements of the secondary theme near the start of the development suggest a futile striving for this lost ideal, soon drowned out by the troubled chromatic music. This corruption of the ideal sets in motion a characteristically Wagnerian regenerative process, the final stage of which is the redemption, the return to the ideal. All of the music from the moment of the corruption may be considered part of a struggle to reach this moment of redemption – the <em>telos</em> – which is, in a sense, ‘the moment the entire work has been constructed to produce’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref138" href='#_ftn138'>[138]</a></p>
    <p>Relevant here is James Hepokoski’s concept of ‘teleological genesis’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref139" href='#_ftn139'>[139]</a> This process is apparent in works where there is ‘a decisive climax or final goal (<em>telos</em>)’, and where the music is ‘gradually generative towards the revelation of a higher or fuller condition’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref140" href='#_ftn140'>[140]</a> Often this is combined with rotational structures in which ‘a motivic gesture or hint planted in an early rotation grows in later rotations and is ultimately unfurled as the <em>telos</em> in the final one’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref141" href='#_ftn141'>[141]</a> <em>Tintagel</em> certainly works towards a decisive climax, but its process of teleological genesis differs in significant ways from the descriptions just given. Although the statements of the secondary theme in the development might be regarded as the planting of seeds which will fully flower later in the piece, <em>Tintagel</em> does not involve ‘successively more “revelatory”’ rotations of the same motivic material.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref142" href='#_ftn142'>[142]</a> Furthermore, because in <em>Tintagel</em> the exposition has already presented ideal, fully-formed versions of both themes in the tonic key, the <em>telos</em> (the recapitulatory statement of the secondary theme) constitutes the endpoint of a process of <em>re</em>generation. The secondary theme certainly emerges transformed, but it also recovers something that the work has already presented us with. Thus it might be more suitable to speak of a process of ‘teleological regeneration’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref143" href='#_ftn143'>[143]</a></p>
    <p>      If the exposition presents an ideal picture of Ireland, the development suggests a nation in chaos after an imagined Fall. The ‘Sick Tristan’ motif often seems to be in competition with the other chromatic motif that dominates the development. The constant alternation between these two motifs, in addition to the development’s generally agitated atmosphere, creates a sense of conflict (hence the name given to the motif shown in Ex. 6.8). Moreover, this ‘Conflict’ motif often sounds threatening and sometimes even militaristic, particularly at bars 109 and 113. In his orchestral work <em>In Memoriam</em> (1916), Bax more explicitly evoked a militaristic atmosphere with the use of a side-drum and ominous marching rhythms. In that work, too, the conflict is found in the music’s central section, framed by a B major ‘Irish tune’. Perhaps, then, more than just suggesting Bax’s inner, private conflict, the development of <em>Tintagel</em> could also be linked to the real-world conflict of Easter 1916. As with his <em>Symphonic Variations</em> (also composed in 1917), in which Bax depicted ‘Strife’ eventually being overcome by ‘Triumph’, so too in <em>Tintagel</em> might the development represent the strife, and perhaps even the revolutionary violence, required to achieve victory.</p>
    
    <caption><strong>Example 6.8</strong> Bax, <em>Tintagel</em>, b. 76, ‘Conflict’ motif</caption>
    <div class="image-container">
    <img src="/images/placeholder.png" alt="Example 6.8 Bax, Tintagel, b. 76" class="modalImages modalImage">
    </div>

    <p>In any case, the struggle in the developmental space and the difficulty of recovering the ideal of the exposition proves to be so great that the struggle spills over into the start of the recapitulation. Now, though, one senses that the <em>telos</em>, the triumph, is imminent. The striving towards this goal becomes ever more urgent. The two climactic crescendos culminating with the <em>sforzando</em> chords over bars 164–8 and 182–6, in particular, suggest that the moment of regeneration is within touching distance. The second of these climaxes, a diminished seventh chord on B, described by Bax as the waves smashing against the rocks, recalls a similarly climactic moment four bars before fig. T in <em>The Garden of Fand</em>. There, too, the music, according to Bax’s programme, represents a massive wave – the one that engulfs Fand’s island and kills the mortal voyagers. For Bax, the sea symbolized death as well as sexual desire.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref144" href='#_ftn144'>[144]</a> This link between the sea and death is evidenced not just by <em>Fand</em> but by Bax’s literary works as well. Two of his stories, <em>The Sisters</em> and <em>Green Magic</em> (1912), both involve characters drowning in the Atlantic Ocean, which is described in the first story as the ‘fatal sea’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref145" href='#_ftn145'>[145]</a> In the fourth stanza of Bax’s poem ‘A Dublin Ballad – 1916’, he writes that the English army, sent to suppress the insurrection in Dublin, ‘swarmed in from the fatal sea’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref146" href='#_ftn146'>[146]</a> Following Puffett’s suggestion that the programme of <em>Fand</em> can be used to interpret Bax’s later sea music, the violent crashing wave at bar 186 of <em>Tintagel</em> might be interpreted as representing some kind of death. This is especially significant because it is this death that finally ushers in the redemptive <em>telos</em>. Just as Pearse believed there had to be a blood sacrifice – his own death – to bring about the redemption of Ireland and the revival of a heroic age, so too in <em>Tintagel</em> is the moment of regeneration achieved only after the fatal sea asserts itself most violently.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref147" href='#_ftn147'>[147]</a> As in <em>Tristan</em>, death and redemption coincide in the transcendental key of B major. Moreover, the link between a Celtic sea and death aligns <em>Tintagel</em> with other British Wagnerian works which draw on the same <em>Tristan</em>-inspired association, such as Smyth’s <em>The Wreckers</em> and Holbrooke’s <em>Dylan</em>.</p>
    <p>The recapitulation of the secondary theme not only revives the ideal of the exposition but transforms it into something new. The theme has now lost its femininity and undergone a process of masculinization. The recapitulatory statement of the secondary theme suggests the new, heroic, masculine Ireland that Pearse hoped his sacrifice would bring about. There is clearly a parallel here with the last two lines of Bax’s poem ‘The East Clare Election: 1917’: ‘And we must drench in blood and sweat before we turn to kiss / In grianans and cashels of an Ireland built anew’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref148" href='#_ftn148'>[148]</a> Only after the struggle of the development and the effortful striving at the start of the recapitulation – the (masculine) blood, sweat, and potentially even a sacrificial death – can the new heroic Ireland emerge. A further analogy might be drawn with the cyclical evolution proposed by Blavatsky, described above. The exposition could represent an ancient Irish civilization at the height of its greatness which falls into decline in the development. The recapitulation then signals the beginning of a new cycle in which ‘humanity reasserts itself and mounts up once more’ – it regenerates – only this time when it reaches ‘the height of its attainment’ (at b. 190) it peaks at a higher point than the previous cycle. </p>
    <p>      We can now begin to see how two apparently conflicting statements Bax made about <em>Tintagel</em> might be reconciled. On the one hand, Bax wrote in his programme that ‘the piece ends as it began’, implying that the narrative of <em>Tintagel</em> is ultimately cyclical. On the other hand, Bax praised a performance of the work conducted by Dan Godfrey because of the ‘wonderful sense of shape and growth’ he put into the piece: ‘a gradual development from the first bar to the last’. Bax added that he did not think <em>Tintagel</em> could ‘ever be better played in this respect’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref149" href='#_ftn149'>[149]</a> These cyclical and teleological conceptions of <em>Tintagel</em> need not be mutually exclusive. Indeed, one might suggest that the work contains a teleological trajectory – from the start of the development to the secondary theme in the recapitulation – encapsulated within a larger cyclical one, spanning the whole work and involving the revival of the exposition’s ideal.</p>
    <p>This is not the whole story, however, as what happens between the <em>telos</em> and the final few triumphant bars of B major complicates matters. The <em>per aspera ad astra</em> trajectory, having achieved its goal, breaks down at the end of the recapitulation. Bars 210–17 signal another decay, a corruption of the regenerated ideal. Some early reviews of the work observed the sense of anti-climax this engenders.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref150" href='#_ftn150'>[150]</a> This apparent anti-climax might be considered in terms of what Warren Darcy refers to as the ‘rebirth paradigm’, according to which ‘a symphonic movement passes through a series of metaphorical “deaths” and “rebirths”’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref151" href='#_ftn151'>[151]</a> He writes that such a ‘metaphorical death’ often occurs soon after the <em>telos</em> amid a ‘recapitulatory crisis’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref152" href='#_ftn152'>[152]</a> Typically, though, there is one ‘final rebirth’ in the coda.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref153" href='#_ftn153'>[153]</a> In <em>Tintagel</em> this second death creates the impression that the cycle of ideal-corruption-regeneration could, or has already begun to, repeat itself all over again. In fact, the coda presents this whole process in miniature: there is the triplet figure (S<sup>1.0</sup>) that accompanied the ideal, feminine, expositional version of the secondary theme (bb. 218–19); then there is the decay (a third death, perhaps) represented by the ‘Sick Tristan’ motif (bb. 220–3); and finally the striving for (bb. 224–7) and the achievement of the regeneration with the jubilant, fortissimo B major ending. Despite this final rebirth, it is still the last haunting statement of the ‘Sick Tristan’ motif that stands out above all else (Ex. 6.9). We might now return to the question of what this uncanny voice could be narrating.</p>
    
    <caption><strong>Example 6.9</strong> Bax, <em>Tintagel</em>, bb. 222–224</caption>
    <div class="image-container">
    <img src="/images/placeholder.png" alt="Example 6.9 Bax, Tintagel, bb. 222–224" class="modalImages modalImage">
    </div>

    <p>Abbate notes that moments of narration are often ‘charged with a sense of both distance and difference’, and Matthew McDonald has pointed out that narrators themselves ‘tend to be far removed from the events they present and comment on’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref154" href='#_ftn154'>[154]</a> It is significant, then, that Bax was in England, both at the time of the Rising and when he composed <em>Tintagel</em>, and thus at a spatial and (when he wrote the work) temporal distance from Ireland and the insurrection.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref155" href='#_ftn155'>[155]</a> Moreover, as noted above, the music of Ex. 6.9 stands out in the context of the work itself. It is certainly charged with a sense of difference, and it is at a temporal distance from the agitated music of the development from which it derives. Considering also the Irish connotations of the ‘Sick Tristan’ motif, we might propose that this voice mourns the loss that was required to achieve the regeneration of the Irish ideal. Although Abbate’s ‘aural vision of music animated by multiple, decentered voices localized in several invisible bodies’, is cast in opposition to the ‘monologic and controlling “composer’s voice”’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref156" href='#_ftn156'>[156]</a> it is difficult to dissociate the music of Ex. 6.9 from Bax himself, at a distance from Ireland and mourning the death of Pearse.</p>
    <p>The significance of these two bars might be further elucidated by their similarity to another Wagnerian leitmotif, shown in Ex. 6.10. This motif is associated with Brünnhilde’s magic sleep at the end of <em>Die Walküre</em>, and with oblivion when it reappears near the end of <em>Götterdämmerung</em>, as Brünnhilde rides into the flames of Siegfried’s funeral pyre. As in Ex. 6.9, Wagner’s leitmotif is characterized by a sense of contraction, created by the contrary motion, and by its smooth chromatic voice-leading. Furthermore, the movement by thirds in the bass of Ex. 6.9 (C–E–G–B) resembles the chromatic mediant relationship between the chords appearing on the first beat of every other bar in the Wagner example (though there the thirds are descending rather than ascending). In recalling the end of the world pictured at the close of Wagner’s <em>Ring</em> cycle, and the moment when Wotan kisses Brünnhilde goodbye at the end of <em>Die Walküre</em>, perhaps Bax was saying a final farewell to his ‘Celtic wonderland’ that had gone up in flames.</p>

    <h2>6.4 Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">The Easter Rising brought a violent, bloody conflict into Bax’s dream-world; it meant a devastating collision of this dream-world and reality. Bax wrote that ‘the catastrophe of 1914 […] bundled away dreams such as those in which I had hitherto indulged’, but it was the events of 1916 that quite literally saw his Celtic wonderland burned to the ground.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref157" href='#_ftn157'>[157]</a> The new, masculine Ireland came (or would come) at a price: the death of the dreamy mythological Ireland.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref158" href='#_ftn158'>[158]</a> Aidan Thomson suggests that Bax’s rejection of Celtic mythology, or ‘overt Celticism’, for nature as a compositional stimulus was part of a process of masculinizing the ‘Celtic Other’, a process which paralleled earlier developments in Irish literature.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref159" href='#_ftn159'>[159]</a> The trigger for Bax’s ‘retreat’ to a more masculine conception of Celticism was Pearse’s real-life, modern-day heroism. The dawning of a new era in Ireland’s history required from Bax a more masculine kind of music to match it. </p>
    <p>      As Thomson explains, Bax’s rejection, after the First World War, of the ‘overt Celticism’ of his earlier tone poems ‘involved rejecting not only the mythology but the values associated with it’. This paved the way for the ‘more austere, consciously abstract symphonies’ that Bax composed during the next two decades.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref160" href='#_ftn160'>[160]</a> The retreat from Celtic mythology, then, had to go hand in hand with a rejection of the influences of Wagnerism and Theosophy as well, as these movements represented the same feminine, sentimental, dreamy, anti-materialist values. Bax’s fascination with dreams and with a world beyond the veil (themes common to both Wagner and Theosophy) were incompatible with a new Ireland trying to assert itself as a powerful independent nation fully engaged with reality.</p>
    <p><em>Tintagel</em>, with its Wagnerian allusions and chromaticisms, and its connections with Arthurian mythology, might appear to belong to the group of Bax’s earlier ‘feminine’ works. But unlike most of Bax’s previous tone poems, ‘nature predominates over mythology’ in <em>Tintagel</em>, as one critic put it in the 1930s.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref161" href='#_ftn161'>[161]</a> This aligns it with his later works, associated with the harsh landscapes and seascapes of a more general ‘Celtic North’, but which were not explicitly connected to mythology.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref162" href='#_ftn162'>[162]</a> Moreover, the transformation of the work’s ‘Irish’ secondary theme – from feminine and sentimental in the exposition, to masculine and heroic in the recapitulation – can be interpreted as an acting out of this aesthetic shift, of his masculinization of the ‘Celtic Other’, within the work itself. The work offers a snapshot of this turning point in Bax’s life and development as a composer; it signals the end of his most fervent phase of fascination with Celtic mythology and a feminine Ireland, but it also promises a new beginning, looking forward, like his contemporaneous poetry, to ‘an Ireland built anew’.</p>
    <p>As argued in previous chapters of this thesis, a Celtic, pantheistic conception of nature (a ‘Celtic North’ aesthetic) in British music was indebted to the influence of Wagner, so there is a sense in which even Bax’s post-war approach to musical Celticism could ultimately be traced back to the German composer. But by distancing his Celticism from Wagnerian mythology and by expressing it in a musical language that became increasingly un-Wagnerian in the decades following the First World War – as Bax came under the influence of Sibelian musical practices and aesthetics – Bax effectively severed ties between his pantheistic Celticism and Wagner altogether. While one of the main triggers for Bax’s retreat from Wagnerism – the Easter Rising – was not a particularly significant event for other British Wagnerian composers, the even greater catastrophe of the First World War had a similar effect on British Wagnerites, even if there was still a Wagnerian afterglow that persisted in the 1920s (in the form of works like Holbrooke’s <em>Bronwen</em>).</p>
    <p>While it could be argued that the First World War crushed composers’ hopes for regenerating or re-enchanting the world, the ‘Irish’ reading of <em>Tintagel</em> outlined above highlights the fact that conflict, whether in the form of an Irish uprising or a world war, could be, and was, interpreted as just another period of decline within a larger process of regeneration. The decline of British musical Wagnerism, then, was not the result of an abandonment of the fundamental hopes and values which underpinned the movement, but a change in the kind of means by which such ideas were expressed. The First World War contributed to a change in aesthetic tastes that almost immediately made Wagnerian and post-Wagnerian musical styles and themes unfashionable. New influences from the Continent soon overtook Wagner and finally consigned British musical Wagnerism to history: Sessa writes that the Great War ‘made total what was already a partial eclipse of Wagner brought about by the growing popularity of Schonberg, Stravinsky, Bartok, [and] Satie’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref163" href='#_ftn163'>[163]</a> A number of the composers studied in this thesis (excepting Parry and Elgar, and to a lesser extent Bax) suffered the same fate. Beginning in the 1920s they were increasingly pushed to the periphery of British musical life and have been marginalised ever since. It is hoped that this thesis has gone some way towards bringing to light the significant contribution that these composers made to British culture, as well as illustrating the diverse and fascinating ways in which Wagnerism shaped British music in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<span class="squarestop">∎</span></p>

Both operas involve a scene in which elves (in <em>Caedmar</em>), or gnomes and fairies (in <em>Diarmid</em>) come out to dance while the male protagonist – a sort of Tristan/Siegfried character in both – lies sleeping. </p>
      <p><a id="_ftn9" href='#_ftnref9'>[9]</a> Lewis Foreman writes that ‘<em>Tintagel</em> remained in the repertory when much of Bax’s music was no longer heard’.

      <p><a id="_ftn10" href='#_ftnref10'>[10]</a> <em>Tintagel</em> was premiered on 20 October 1921 at the Bournemouth Symphony Concerts. The performance was conducted by Dan Godfrey.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn11" href='#_ftnref11'>[11]</a> There exist two programmes for <em>Tintagel</em> written by Bax: the short description found in the opening pages of the published orchestral score, and an extended version of this which Bax wrote for the performance of <em>Tintagel</em> at the Leeds Festival in 1922. The latter programme is quoted in full below, and it is from that programme that the above quotes are taken.

Similarly, Fabian Huss has recently suggested that the influence of Irish folk music enabled Bax to distance himself from ‘established, largely outmoded continental practices’. Huss, ‘The “Irish Music” of Arnold Bax and E. J. Moeran’, 72.

Of the titles Bax gave to each variation, two suggest a possible link to the events of 1916: the third is named ‘Strife’, and the last is named ‘Triumph’. Foreman suggests that this ‘Strife’ may refer to a ‘domestic conflict’ between him and his wife but does not expand on the idea that the work might be linked to the Easter Rising.

      <p><a id="_ftn68" href='#_ftnref68'>[68]</a> The <em>Phantasy</em> quotes music from ‘Amhrán na bhFiann’ (‘The Soldier’s Song’, now the Irish national anthem), which was popular with the Irish Volunteers, and frequently sung in the internment camps for Irish prisoners following the Easter Rising. See Ruth Sherry, ‘The Story of the National Anthem’, <em>History Ireland</em>, 4/1 (1996), 39–43 at 39–40. Bax’s quotation of this music occurs in the bass at letter ‘X’ in the score of the <em>Phantasy</em>. It is the melody which accompanies the last two lines of the song’s chorus, ‘‘Mid cannon’s roar and rifles’ peal / We’ll chant a soldier&#39;s song’.

Bars 13–20 fulfil the presentation function of a sentence: the dotted fanfare – the four-bar ‘basic idea’ – is repeated underneath the horns in bb. 17–20. The music following this displays the kind of fragmentation typical of a continuation section of a sentence, and ultimately leads to the resolution in the tonic at b. 27.</p>

      <p><a id="_ftn83" href='#_ftnref83'>[83]</a> Evidently this is not a very conventional IAC, but the V–I motion is still apparent. The music of bar 54 is essentially just a prolongation of the dominant seventh (or ninth) chord. The use of an IAC as a substitute for the more common PAC is considered by Hepokoski and Darcy in <em>Elements of Sonata Theory</em>, 167–9.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn84" href='#_ftnref84'>[84]</a> Ibid. 133, 147. Christopher Whelen has observed that there is frequently a ‘feminine element’ to the secondary themes in the first movements of Bax’s symphonies.

There are further specific parallels between <em>Tintagel</em> and the Overture to <em>Holländer</em>. The secondary theme in the latter also cadences in the tonic key (though it is a half cadence), and both works are, to some extent, depictions of the sea. Steven Vande Moortele writes that ‘on a deeper structural level, the entire exposition [of the <em>Holländer</em> overture] resides firmly in the tonic’. Vande Moortele, ‘Form, Narrative and Intertextuality in Wagner’s Overture to <em>Der Fliegende Holl**änder</em>’, <em>Music Analysis</em>, 32 (2013), 46–79 at 57. Aidan Thomson writes that Bax’s Fourth Symphony also seems to ‘uphold the Romantic symphonic paradigm of <em>per aspera ad astra</em>’. Thomson, ‘Bax’s “Sea Symphony”’.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn88" href='#_ftnref88'>[88]</a> In an interview in 1921, Bax claimed that ‘the contrapuntal basis’ of his harmony was exemplified by Wagner’s music: ‘my harmonies come about as the result of contrapuntal movement. It’s no use thinking in up and down blocks of harmony if you’re trying to read my things: each part must be taken as a melodic line’. Katharine E. Eggar, ‘The Piano Pieces of Arnold Bax’, <em>Music Student</em>, 14 (Nov. 1921), 65–7, 78. Reprinted in Bax, <em>Farewell, My Youth</em>, 161–2.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn89" href='#_ftnref89'>[89]</a> As the motivic material of the majority (notwithstanding the opening) of this development is not based on expositional ideas, ‘developmental space’ is the more appropriate term here, as it ‘does not imply the inescapable presence of thematic back-reference’. Hepokoski and Darcy, <em>Elements of Sonata Theory</em>, 196.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn90" href='#_ftnref90'>[90]</a> These four zones (‘not all of which need to be deployed in any given work’) may be summarised as follows: the first zone is a ‘short, optional <em>link</em> from the preceding retransition (RT) or from the last module of C’; the second is the ‘<em>entry or preparation zone</em>’; the third is ‘<em>the central action</em> or <em>set of actions</em>’, or ‘central action-space’; and the fourth is the ‘<em>exit</em> or <em>retransition</em>’. Ibid. 229–30. </p>
      <p><a id="_ftn91" href='#_ftnref91'>[91]</a> Hans von Wolzogen seems to have been the first to assign the motif this label, describing it as ‘Motiv des siechen Tristan’.

      <p><a id="_ftn93" href='#_ftnref93'>[93]</a> Delius also alludes to the motif in his <em>Sea Drift</em> (1903–4), at the words ‘O I am very sick and sorrowful’, just before fig. 23.

      <p><a id="_ftn95" href='#_ftnref95'>[95]</a> Puffett, ‘In the Garden of Fand: Arnold Bax and the “Celtic Twilight”’, 202. Aidan Thomson describes these recurring themes as ‘archetypes’. Thomson, ‘Bax and the “Celtic North”’, 70.</p>

      <p><a id="_ftn97" href='#_ftnref97'>[97]</a> Parallels might again be drawn with the Overture to <em>Der Fliegende Holländer</em>, in which, Steven Vande Moortele notes, the ‘conceptual space’ for the jubilant recapitulation of the secondary theme is ‘wrenched open’ by the primary theme-based music of the preceding bars. Vande Moortele, ‘Form, Narrative and Intertextuality in Wagner’s Overture to <em>Der Fliegende Holl**änder</em>’, 57.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn98" href='#_ftnref98'>[98]</a> In terms of Sonata Theory, this interpretation makes much more sense than claiming that the recapitulation begins at the return of the secondary theme at b. 190. Hepokoski and Darcy claim that a recapitulation cannot begin with an S-module. See Hepokoski and Darcy, <em>Elements of Sonata Theory</em>, 231–2. Moreover, the withholding of the tonic key until the recapitulation of the secondary theme is a common sonata-form deformation that developed during the nineteenth century; Hepokoski writes that it was ‘possible to bypass the tonic recapitulation of the first theme, merging into the “tonal resolution” only at or around the point of the second theme’. Hepokoski, ‘Beethoven Reception’, 452.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn99" href='#_ftnref99'>[99]</a> The move to the subdominant here is not particularly problematic as it merely parallels the brief tonicisation of E major in the exposition (at b. 43), and after four bars (the presentation) the continuation part of the sentence pushes the music back to the tonic, B major (clearly reached at the start of b. 210).</p>

      <p><a id="_ftn107" href='#_ftnref107'>[107]</a> Similarly, in <em>Die Walküre</em> the genuine – but prohibited and incestuous – love between Siegmund and Sieglinde is opposed to the latter’s abusive and loveless, but nonetheless societally-approved, marriage to Hunding.

      <p><a id="_ftn114" href='#_ftnref114'>[114]</a> This may seem like a rather bold claim were it not for the crucial position <em>Fand</em> occupies in Bax’s output. Puffett writes that <em>Fand</em> ‘is a fruitful source for his later music; we might almost call it his key work’, while Thomson notes that ‘the seeds of Bax’s later style were sown most effectively’ in <em>Fand</em>. Bax himself evidently regarded it as an important work, once remarking to Harriet Cohen that <em>Fand</em> was the ‘last of [his] Irish music’.

      <p><a id="_ftn115" href='#_ftnref115'>[115]</a> In Celtic mythology the entrance to the Otherworld was commonly thought to be found somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. See Wentz, <em>The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries</em>, 333; and MacKillop, <em>A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology</em>, 359.

      <p><a id="_ftn118" href='#_ftnref118'>[118]</a> This denied resolution, ultimately achieved at the end of the work, is like a microscopic version of a similar process played out over the last two acts of <em>Tristan</em>. At the end of scene II, Act II – the end of Tristan and Isolde’s night-time tryst – the anticipated resolution of twelve bars of dominant pedal on F# is denied by one of the most jarring interruptions of the external world in the whole drama: Kurvenal bursts in on the lovers to warn them that Melot and Marke are approaching. As in <em>Tintagel</em>, the resolution to B major, avoided at this earlier stage in the drama, is ultimately achieved at the very end of the work.</p>

While there are further examples in Bax’s output of the ‘Irish tune’ functioning as the main or first theme of a work or movement (often appearing after an introductory section in a ternary form), its more natural position – taking into account its often lyrical, feminine qualities – is as a secondary theme in a work in dialogue with sonata form. Examples are to be found, among other places, in <em>Into The Twilight</em> (1908), <em>November Woods</em>, and in the first movements of the First (1921–2) and Seventh (1938–9) Symphonies (occurring only briefly in the latter). Aidan Thomson notes that the opposites in Bax’s music observed by Colin Scott-Sutherland – ‘Bax, the Romantic’ and ‘Bax, the Celt’ – ‘are typical of Bax’s first and second subjects respectively’.

      <p><a id="_ftn147" href='#_ftnref147'>[147]</a> Parallels can be drawn here with nationalist music from other European countries which sought to depict the revival of the ideals of a heroic past. A good example is Bedřich Smetana’s cycle of six symphonic poems, <em>Má vlast</em>, composed in the 1870s. The first part of the cycle, <em>Vyšehrad</em>, depicts the eponymous ancient castle which stands on a rock above the River Vltava in Prague. The music first depicts the castle in all its former glory and subsequently its ‘fall and decay’ – the ruins of the castle in the present day. <em>Blaník</em>, the title of the sixth and final part of the cycle, is a mountain, in which, according to myth, the revolutionary fifteenth-century Hussite knights had gone into hiding and entered a ‘profound sleep’. When their country needed them most, the Hussites would awaken from their slumber in the mountain, defeat the enemies of the Czech people, and bring about the establishment of an independent Czech nation. At the end of <em>Blaník</em>, at the apotheosis of the whole cycle, a theme from <em>Vyšehrad</em> returns, signalling the regeneration of the ancient heroic ideal embodied by the Hussites. See David Bruce Mead, ‘The Symphonic Structure of Smetana’s “Má vlast”’ (Ph.D. diss., University of Texas, 1994), 47–60, 157–8; Kelly St. Pierre, ‘Smetana’s “Vyšehrad” and Mythologies of Czechness in Scholarship’, <em>19th-Century Music</em>, 37 (2013), 91–112; Michael Beckerman, ‘In Search of Czechness in Music’, <em>19th-Century Music</em>, 10 (1986), 61–73. <em>Vyšehrad</em> was performed at the same concert in which Bax’s <em>A Connemara Revel</em> was premiered in April 1905, so he would have been at least vaguely familiar with the work. ‘Royal Academy of Music’, <em>Musical Times</em>, 46 (1905), 330.</p>
