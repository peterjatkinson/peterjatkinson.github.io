    <h1>APPENDIX I</h1>
    <h1>OPERA PLOT SUMMARIES</h1>
    <h2><em>Guenever</em></h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">Act I</p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><em>Outside Chester walls. Trumpet calls in the town. Early morning. ? (I’m not sure sunset wouldn’t be more to the point). Crowd of town and country people gathering and dancing</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref1" href='#_ftn1'>[1]</a></p>
    <p class="first-para-section">Following an opening chorus, executioners enter and pile wood to prepare for the burning of Guenever at the stake. The crowd begins to disperse and Gareth enters, bringing news that Lancelot approaches and intends to slay all those ‘that ill of his Lady’s love hath spoken’. Mordred arrives and dismisses Gareth’s pleas for ‘one more day of grace’. A bewildered Guenever is led out to the stake and is condemned by Mordred and a bloodthirsty crowd. Guenever makes an impassioned defence of her innocence, and consequently Gareth tries to help her but is immobilized by Mordred’s men. At the moment the fire is lit, Lancelot and his knights arrive at speed, knocking the crowd aside. In the ensuing chaos Lancelot, ‘coming rapidly behind Gareth &amp; mistaking him for one of the executioners strikes him down’. Lancelot puts out the fire and helps Guenever down.</p>
    <p class="first-para-section">Act II</p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><em>A large hall with large doorway with curtains in the centre, &amp; small door on one side &amp; a window on the opposite side. A dais with throne. Ladies gathered near the window embroidering</em>.</p>
    <p class="first-para-section">A chorus of ladies recounts the tragic love of Tristram, Isoud [<em>sic</em>] and King Mark, before a group of ‘Knights enter bearing the body of Gareth’. Lyones, Gareth’s wife, enters the hall and throws herself on his body. She curses whoever slew Gareth, and is soon told by Mordred that it was Lancelot. Arthur enters and Mordred informs him of the events at the stake. Lancelot arrives with his knights, eventually followed by Guenever, and the two lovers plead for Arthur’s forgiveness. The knights who are present swear not to doubt Guenever again, and Arthur forgives her while proclaiming that he and Lancelot must be enemies until death. After Lancelot and Guenever bid their farewells, a chorus of Arthurs’ knights prepare for war (‘Bear forth the banner’). Arthur recalls a dream he had the previous night in which he was met by Gareth and a ‘mystic throng’ in Avalon. Arthur kisses Guenever farewell and leaves for battle. Mordred enters and seeks Guenever’s pardon, which she does not grant him, and then he reveals to the Queen his treacherous plans to usurp Arthur. A group of knights swear allegiance to Mordred and to Arthur’s death.</p>
    <p class="first-para-section">Act III</p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><em>On the borders of a lake. A small chapel to one side. Darkness. [Translated from Althaus’s German:] After a prelude Lyones appears and turns to the chapel, where she kneels in a dark room by a discernible image of the Mother of God</em>.</p>
    <p class="first-para-section">After a lament by Lyones, in which she repeats her wish for Lancelot’s downfall, Mordred enters stating that he has slain Arthur in battle but has yet to find his body among the dead. Arthur, not dead after all, arrives angrily and a fight breaks out between Arthur, Mordred and their respective knights, culminating with Mordred’s death. Lyones emerges from the shadows and vows to kill Guenever. Arthur asks Lyones to forget her wrath and to take to Guenever a ring and a message: ‘Arthur calleth. He weds thee with this ring anew and at god’s high throne he bids thee meet him’. Lyones agrees and exits. Arthur asks a few of his knights to take his sword and throw it into the water. While they do this, Arthur has a vision of a future regenerated Britain. The knights return and inform Arthur that an arm rose from the water and grabbed the sword. Arthur asks them to carry him to the shore, where a barge of queens approaches to take Arthur to Avalon. Arthur is placed in the barge and the act ends with the knights lamenting Arthur’s passing, along with a chorus of queens.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref2" href='#_ftn2'>[2]</a></p>
    <p class="first-para-section">Act IV</p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><em>The court of a nunnery. In the centre the door of a large church with steps up to it. At the side a door to enter the precincts from without</em>.</p>
    <p class="first-para-section">Guenever laments that she will not see Lancelot again, and she asks God to bring her death. Lancelot arrives at the nunnery, suggesting that now Arthur is dead, he (Lancelot) and Guenever should resume their relations. Guenever is reluctant at first but soon gives Lancelot her hand. A love duet ensues, and after some seduction from Lancelot the pair kiss. Lyones suddenly appears bearing Arthur’s ring and message, along with a warning that the lovers’ joy will be short-lived. After Lyones’s exit Lancelot bolts the doors to the court shut to keep out a group of knights who call for ‘Death to the traitor’ and eventually break their way in. While Lancelot is fending off the knights, a group of women also burst in exclaiming ‘Slay the adulteress’. Lyones sneaks past Lancelot and stabs Guenever. The fighting ceases and Guenever sings one last time to welcome death and to pray that she may be forgiven and her soul ascend to heaven. The opera ends with a chorus of nuns praying for Guenever’s forgiveness as ‘They bear her on a shield in procession into the church’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref3" href='#_ftn3'>[3]</a></p>

    <h2><em>Caedmar</em></h2>
    <p class="first-para-section" class="first-para-section">Caedmar, an errant knight, falls asleep in a glade in the woods. ‘Little elves’ come out to dance around him in the moonlight. After the elves have disappeared, Hulda, wife of the hunter Andred, enters the glade and sings of her despair (‘a fugitive from husband and from home’). She notices the sleeping Caedmar and instantaneously falls in love with him. Caedmar awakes and asks Hulda where she has come from and how she ended up here, prompting the beginning of Hulda’s narrative in which she explains how she was forced to marry the abusive Andred. She fled the previous morning while Andred was out hunting, and eventually reached the glade in the woods where Caedmar lay sleeping. She tells Caedmar of her love for him and he reciprocates, swearing to serve and protect her (he is ‘bound by holy vows to succour all in sore distress’). A love duet ensues, culminating with the pair falling into ‘a long embrace’. Their happiness is soon interrupted, however, when Andred discovers the lovers and rushes towards Caedmar with his sword. While the pair are locked in battle Hulda jumps in between them to try to stop the fighting, and she is stabbed by Andred in the midst of the chaos. Caedmar kills Andred and tends to Hulda who clings on to life for a short while longer. After proclaiming her love for Caedmar, she ‘gazes upwards and points to the sky’ where she sees a bright white light and an angel. Hulda ‘sinks back gently, as if transfigured, into Caedmar’s arms, and expires’. All goes dark and Caedmar prays by her body. The opera concludes with the following scene:</p>
    <blockquote><p>the back opens and in flood [sic] of light discloses Hulda’s spirit form bending lovingly over Caedmar, who kneels at her feet, signifying that though Caedmar still lives on earth; yet his soul is with Hulda above. With a crash the vision disappears, and daylight dawns as the curtain descends.</p></blockquote>

    <h2><em>The Birth of Arthur</em></h2>
    <p class="first-para-section" class="first-para-section"><strong>Prelude to Act I</strong></p>
    <p class="first-para-section">The Chorus sings about the mysterious Merlin and the Lake of Wonder.</p>
    <p class="first-para-section" class="first-para-section"><strong>Act I</strong></p>
    <p class="first-para-section" class="first-para-section"><em>Scene I</em>. <em>A Wayside in Cornwall</em></p>
    <p class="first-para-section">A conversation between Uther and Ulfius reveals that Duke Gorlois, ‘Tintagel’s lord’, has been imprisoned by a siege surrounding Terrabyll Castle, and that his wife Igraine is in the keep at Tintagel Castle. Uther recounts the occasion when he first saw and fell in love with Igraine during a banquet hosted by Gorlois. The Duke refused the King’s request to ‘yield’ Igraine to him, and consequently the furious Uther initiated the present conflict. Ulfius suggests that the ‘mage’, Merlin, might help Uther win Igraine. Following Uther’s exit Merlin, disguised as an old man, tells Ulfius that Uther should meet him on the Mount that night.</p>
    <p class="first-para-section" class="first-para-section"><em>Scene II</em>. <em>Merlin’s Mount</em></p>
    <p class="first-para-section">On the Mount Merlin calls on Daranau,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref4" href='#_ftn4'>[4]</a> the ‘god of thunder’, for advice. The ‘Voice of the Storm’, in which ‘works the soul of the World and the Will’, replies that the unborn are crying out to break through into this world. Merlin somehow gleans from this mysterious message that he should use the love of Uther and Igraine to produce ‘the Hero’ through whom ‘Britain may be saved’. Uther arrives and angrily thrusts his sword in the air as he demands that Merlin help him. Merlin shatters Uther’s sword with an effortless gesture and tells the King that he will assist him in acquiring Igraine’s love if he ensures that their relationships brings about a son. Uther agrees and leaves. The act concludes as Merlin speaks of how Britain awaits ‘The coming of a King’.</p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><strong>Prelude to Act II</strong></p>
    <p class="first-para-section">The Chorus describes Tintagel Castle, the stormy sea and Merlin’s cave.</p>
    <p class="first-para-section" class="first-para-section"><strong>Act II</strong> </p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><em>Scene I</em>. <em>The Chamber of Igraine, in Tintagel Castle</em></p>
    <p class="first-para-section">A pensive Igraine tells Brastias of the passion she felt when she first saw Uther at the banquet. Their conversation soon turns to Merlin, whose magic Brastias mistrusts, whereas Igraine describes it as a form of ‘greater knowledge’. Merlin arrives and informs Igraine that she shall bear ‘A wondrous child’. Amidst various interjections from the Will of the World (not heard in a literal sense by the characters, except perhaps by Merlin), Igraine realises that Uther shall be the father of this child, while Merlin proclaims that the child shall be called Arthur and he ‘shall be both king and saviour to his people!’.</p>
    <p class="first-para-section">Having succeeded in gaining entrance to Tintagel Castle, Uther enters Igraine’s chamber where the pair reveal their love for each other, fall into an embrace and disappear behind a curtain. Outside Igraine’s room, Merlin tells Ulfius that Gorlois is now dead before prophesying that Arthur shall lead a ‘glorious kingdom’ but his death will lead to a number of curses falling upon it until the people cry ‘For the second coming of the King!’. The drama ends with the Will of the World speaking of the new ‘promise of the day’ before returning to the Lake of Wonder symbolism from the prelude to the first act.</p>

    <h2><em>The Children of Don</em>&#8288;<a id="_ftnref5" href='#_ftn5'>[5]</a></h2>
    <p class="first-para-section" class="first-para-section"><strong>Prologue</strong>     </p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><em>Scene I. A cavern in the northern isles. Beyond its mouth a lake, choked with ice and obscured by mist that is drifting into the cavern itself. Upon an alter stone within the cavern burns the cauldron of Caridwen. Beside it stands Caridwen.</em></p>
    <p class="first-para-section">A group of priests, led by Arawn (king of Annwn), are about to sacrifice a maiden on the altar when Gwydion (son of Don, the goddess of nature and passion) arrives with the intention of stealing the cauldron. The priests fight him but all of them, including Arawn, are slain. Gwydion takes the cauldron.</p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><em>Scene II. A wild and ice-bound ravine. In the background a rocky peak shrouded in mist. Stormy shadows are sweeping across the scene.</em></p>
    <p class="first-para-section">Don calls on Lyd, the Sea-King, and commands him to destroy her son Gwydion. The Sea-King calls on Nodens (the god of the abyss) who has been placed in an eternal sleep. Nodens speaks of his dreams and predicts that the spirit and strength of the old gods will return again in man. Lyd thus informs Don that he will not harm Gwydion, and speaks of coming conflict.</p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><strong>Act I</strong></p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><em>Scene I. A forest in Arvon.</em></p>
    <p class="first-para-section">A procession of druids carries the cauldron stolen by Gwydion. Gwydion argues with Math (king of Arvon and brother of Don) and Gwion (one of the more zealous druids) because he resents the cauldron having been taken from him. Before their exit, Math and Gwion order Gwydion to protect the cauldron and warn him that there will be disastrous consequences should he fail to do so. </p>
    <p class="first-para-section">Goewin, a priestess, has been affected by the magic of the cauldron and been seduced by Govannion, brother of Gwydion and son of Don. Elan, sister of Gwydion and daughter of Don, interrupts the lovers in the midst of one of their trysts and speaks of her destiny to ‘bear a fateful son’. Gwydion arrives and agrees to conceal Govannion and Goewin’s relations, thus breaking his pledge to Math. After the lovers exit Elan suggests that she and her brother should have a son, but Gwydion refuses.</p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><strong>Act II</strong></p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><em>Scene I. A temple of Trilithons. To right and left in the background are forest hills; in the centre a valley runs down to the sea.</em></p>
    <p class="first-para-section">Goewin admits to Math that she is no longer a virgin and that Govannion is her lover. Math banishes Goewin and orders the druids to bind Gwydion to a stone before the altar where he shall receive his punishment. The druids leave and Elan arrives. Gwydion asks her to fill a horn with the poison from the cauldron, hoping that he will die by drinking it. The pair drink the magic potion. Elan hears the voice of the Sea-King in the distance and is drawn towards it. Alone again, Gwydion sees a vision of Arawn and demons, and he calls on Nodens who prophesises the future triumph of man. The scene darkens and when it lightens again Gwydion is nowhere to be seen – Math’s curse has transformed Gwydion and Govannion into wolves.</p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><strong>Act III</strong></p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><em>Scene I. The same as in Act I., but in autumn. The trees are stripped and brown. The day is drawing to its close. Three years have elapsed since Gwydion and Govannion were condemned to run with the wolf-pack.</em></p>
    <p class="first-para-section">Goewin enters and begs Gwion to allow her to return to live among her people again, but Gwion scolds her and sends her away to be devoured by the wolf-version of Govannion. Math enters and calls on Gwydion and Govannion so that he can reverse his spell, turning them once more into human form. Math tells Gwydion that in order to fully earn his freedom again he must find a new maiden soul to replace Goewin. The pair leave together.</p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><em>Scene II. A rocky seashore. A reef hides the sea-line in the background. From the high rocks to the right a path winds down. To the left the cliffs are beetling and gloomy. It is a wild autumn evening.</em></p>
    <p class="first-para-section">Elan is alone and reminiscing about her love for the Sea-King when Govannion enters and informs her that she has been chosen to replace Goewin as the virgin sacrifice for the cauldron. Math and Gwydion arrive and the former asks Elan to cross a line on the ground that he has drawn with his wand to prove her virginity. When she attempts to cross the line a small boy, Dylan, appears beside her, revealing the result of her affair with the Sea-King. Math believes the boy to be Gwydion’s son and curses the children of Don. Gwydion stabs Math with a spear, while Govannion takes Dylan, throws the boy into the sea and then drags Elan away. Following Math’s death, Gwydion snaps the king’s staff before witnessing Dylan emerge on the rocks (as the son of the Sea-King the water cannot harm him). Gwydion predicts a great future for Dylan but Govannion appears and states that Dylan is ‘foul born’. The two brothers fight until Govannion is driven away. Gwion and the other druids enter, swearing that there will be vengeance for the murder of Math. Govannion murders Gwion and the other druids depart. Gwydion picks up Dylan and proclaims: ‘Nodens dreams on, and we can still be brave, / And while ’tis so the islands shall not fail’.</p>

    <h2><em>Dylan: Son of the Wave</em>&#8288;<a id="_ftnref6" href='#_ftn6'>[6]</a></h2>
    <p class="first-para-section" class="first-para-section"><strong>Act I</strong></p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><em>Scene I. An orchard outside the walls of Gwyddno’s castle. A path leads down from the castle (left) and another passes out (centre) leading down to the plains of Gwaelod. Towards evening.</em></p>
    <p class="first-para-section">Elan is staying at the dun of Gwyddno, king of Ceredigion, accompanied also by Seithenin, keeper of the dykes. Govannion enters and mocks Elan who recalls how her two brothers killed her son, Dylan, unaware that he is in fact still alive. Dylan arrives and is introduced to Elan, who does not recognise him, as an ‘idle foolish bard, and Gwydion’s love-child’. Dylan soon goes out and is followed by Govannion, after which Gwydion enters and reveals that the bard was her son, whom Gwydion has raised. Upon hearing that Govannion followed Dylan out to the shore, Gwydion realises that his brother intends to kill Dylan and that Math’s curse on the children of Don is taking hold.</p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><em>Scene II. The sea shore. (Right) A path from the low cliffs that join the sands (centre) in confused sheets of rock. In the distance the sea. Night.</em></p>
    <p class="first-para-section">While Dylan is admiring the sea, Govannion sneaks up behind him and spears him in the back. As Dylan dies he calls on the wild-fowl to pass on the message that he has been slain by Govannion and he that desires vengeance. The wild-fowl chorus laments Dylan’s death and vows to take his message to the Sea-King.</p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><strong>Act II</strong></p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><em>Scene I. A jagged ravine. From its centre a great mass of rock strikes up out of the sea. Scattered about the ledges of the ravine lie the Sea Folk. The day is lowering and misty.</em></p>
    <p class="first-para-section">The wild-fowl chorus informs the Sea-King and the sea-folk that Dylan is dead. Upon discovering that Govannion has murdered Dylan, the furious Sea-King calls on the forces of the winds and waves to wreak revenge on Govannion. </p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><strong>Act III</strong></p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><em>Scene I. A room in the tower of Seithenin. A forescene shallow and gloomy. Two torches are guttering on the walls.</em></p>
    <p class="first-para-section">Govannion and Seithenin are drinking in the latter’s tower while the chorus of wild-fowl is heard in the distance. Govannion has a feeling of foreboding and eventually leaves the room. </p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><em>Scene II. The scene lightens, shewing a huge sea dyke. A savage oppressive sky overhangs it.</em></p>
    <p class="first-para-section">Looking out to sea, Govannion hears the voice of the vengeful Sea-King and is terrified. The Sea-King commands a storm of wind and waves to attack the land, and soon a large section of the embankment is washed away by the violent waters.</p>
    <p class="first-para-section"><em>Scene III. The gauzes are drawn away, revealing the battlements of Gwyddno’s Castle.</em></p>
    <p class="first-para-section">Govannion begs to be let through the gates of Gwyddno’s castle where he can take shelter, but the Sea-King makes Gwyddno powerless to help Govannion. At the walls of the castle Govannion disappears among the encroaching waves. A dejected Gwyddno lies on the castle wall while the Sea-King reflects on ‘the cycle that the races run’ and expresses his hope that the glory that should have been Dylan’s will be taken up by the ‘sons of Llyr’, thus looking ahead to the final drama of the trilogy, <em>Bronwen</em>. The Sea-King disappears and the ‘scene lightens’ (the day dawns) as the wild-fowl sing a final triumphant chorus.</p>

      <p class="first-para-section"><a id="_ftn1" href='#_ftnref1'>[1]</a> These directions are found on the MS vocal score in Parry’s handwriting, illustrating his uncertainty about certain aspects of the setting.
