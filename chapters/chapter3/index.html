    <h1>CHAPTER 3</h1>
    <h1>Enchanted British Wagnerism in the 1890s: Bantock and Wallace</h1>
    <p class="first-para-section dropcap">Writing in 1980, Derrick Puffett identified a ‘double strain’ of influence running from Wagner’s ‘Celtic’ works – <em>Tristan</em> and <em>Parsifal –</em> into British music. On the one hand, Puffett suggested, was ‘a strain of guilt, anguish and soulful religiosity’, most clearly represented by Elgar’s <em>The Dream of Gerontius</em>; on the other, a ‘pantheistic strain’, discernible, he contended, in certain works by Delius and Bax.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref1" href='#_ftn1'>[1]</a> To explicate these strands of Wagnerian influence in more detail would, Puffett wrote, be a ‘tricky business’. This chapter attempts to go some way towards dealing with this tricky business, and suggests that both of these strands of British Wagnerism first emerged in two musical works premiered in 1892, composed by Granville Bantock and William Wallace. </p>
    <p>      The ‘guilt, anguish and soulful religiosity’ of Puffett’s first strand are signifiers of decadence and are associated with a specifically Catholic kind of mysticism – this is the Wagnerism associated with the atmosphere of ‘erotic religiosity’ identified by Byron Adams in Elgar’s oratorios.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref2" href='#_ftn2'>[2]</a> Wagner’s <em>Parsifal</em>, with its Christian symbolism juxtaposed with scenes of erotic sensuality, was the principal model for this particular brand of mystical-decadent musical Wagnerism, but <em>Lohengrin</em> also provided a source of Wagnerian mysticism, one which was less coloured by decadence. Mysticism and Wagnerism in <em>fin-de-siècle</em> Britain intersected not only in the musical sphere. The Theosophist Wagnerite William Ashton Ellis, for example, began promulgating a ‘mystic’ interpretation of Wagner’s ideas and works in the late 1880s.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref3" href='#_ftn3'>[3]</a> But although Wagner’s mysticism was interpreted in diverse ways, and put to various ends, these mystical British Wagnerisms were united in seeking, or at least seeking to depict, a world beyond the material; an encounter with the sublime, the divine or the infinite; a mystical union with God; or a sense of the oneness of all things. In British music, this impulse first emerged in the form of William Wallace’s symphonic poem <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em> (1892), one of the two works to be examined in this chapter.</p>
    <p>Puffett’s second, ‘pantheistic’ strand of British musical Wagnerism stemmed in part from <em>Parsifal</em>’s ‘Good Friday Music’, in which, Barry Emslie observes, Wagner gave ‘clear expression’ to a ‘religious notion of Nature’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref4" href='#_ftn4'>[4]</a> This pantheistic impulse was by no means confined to Wagner’s last music drama, however. Equally important in terms of a pantheistic influence on British Wagnerian composers were the dramas of the <em>Ring</em>, in which men, gods, and mythological creatures are intimately connected with the natural world. The Rhinemaidens, for instance, who are living embodiments of the river itself – anthropomorphised nature – provide a clear illustration of the oneness of nature and other living beings,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref5" href='#_ftn5'>[5]</a> and the gods, too, are ‘both part of society and personifications of nature’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref6" href='#_ftn6'>[6]</a> The <em>Ring</em> also features ‘the all-loving, all-natural Forest Siegfried’, not only born and raised in the woods, but a man who is eventually able to understand the meaning of birdsong, highlighting ‘his pantheistic status as a child of nature’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref7" href='#_ftn7'>[7]</a> The ‘Waldweben’ music in Act II of <em>Siegfried</em>, depicting the murmurs of an enchanted forest, is an important example of the pantheistic impulse in Wagner’s work, and echoes of this music can be found in the other work that forms the focus of this chapter: Granville Bantock’s one-act opera <em>Caedmar</em> (1892). The idea of the enchanted forest or woods, in which nature appears to be ‘alive’, magical or divine, is a recurring theme in works by late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century British composers: in addition to Bantock’s opera, this theme is present in Smyth’s <em>Der Wald</em>, Bax’s <em>November Woods</em>, and the third scene of Elgar’s <em>Caractacus</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref8" href='#_ftn8'>[8]</a></p>
    <p>The pantheistic aspect of these works does not take the form of a codified religious belief or a coherent system of ideas, but rather a more vague nature mysticism in which the natural world is presented as awe-inspiring, divine or experienced as sublime. There is an overlap, then, between Puffett’s two strands of Wagnerism: both can be viewed as modes of re-enchantment, the difference being that one sought this enchantment through religious or spiritual subject matter and the other in nature.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref9" href='#_ftn9'>[9]</a> The two works that initiated these strands of British musical Wagnerism were premiered within two months of each other at the Crystal Palace in 1892. The stage premiere of Bantock’s <em>Caedmar</em> came first, on 18 October,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref10" href='#_ftn10'>[10]</a> and was followed a month later by the premiere of William Wallace’s symphonic poem <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em> on 26 November. Before examining these works in detail, this chapter will examine the ways in which their composers promoted a progressive, (post-)Wagnerian musical agenda during the 1890s, in particular through their journal the <em>New Quarterly Musical Review</em>, a concert they organised at the Queen’s Hall in 1896 and the aesthetic ideas that underpinned their musical practice.</p>
    
    <h2>3.1 <em>The New Quarterly Musical Review</em></h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">As noted in the Introduction, <em>The Meister</em>, though the official journal of British Wagnerism in the 1890s,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref11" href='#_ftn11'>[11]</a> was not a place where Wagnerian or post-Wagnerian music was discussed, and neither did it provide an outlet for the writings of British Wagnerian musicians or composers. Partially filling this void was the <em>New Quarterly Musical Review</em> (May 1893–Feb. 1896), edited by Bantock. The ‘inner circle of the staff’ at the journal consisted also of William Wallace and H. Orsmond Anderton, who acted as assistant editors, and Erskine Allon, who was responsible for reviewing new sheet music publications.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref12" href='#_ftn12'>[12]</a> Wallace and Allon were students with Bantock at the Royal Academy of Music, where Bantock studied between September 1888 and July 1892 (Wallace also began studies at the RAM in 1888 but left before Bantock).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref13" href='#_ftn13'>[13]</a> Anderton was a lifelong friend of Bantock and later became the composer’s biographer.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref14" href='#_ftn14'>[14]</a></p>
    <p>The introduction to the journal, penned by Anderton, stated that its aim was not to provide ‘musical news’ or ‘reports of concerts’; rather, ‘the most important feature’ of the journal was to be ‘the papers by eminent musicians, on every variety of musical subject’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref15" href='#_ftn15'>[15]</a> In the first issue of the third volume, Bantock summarised the content of the two preceding volumes of his journal, noting that it had included articles ‘on the aesthetics and technique of music’, ‘its composers’ and ‘exhaustive analyses of important published works’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref16" href='#_ftn16'>[16]</a> The first article in the inaugural issue of the journal gave an indication of the stance of its editors and of what was to appear in subsequent issues. It was entitled ‘Modern Orchestration’ and was written by Bantock and Wallace’s former teacher at the RAM, Alexander Mackenzie. Mackenzie was a supporter of Wagner and personal friend of Liszt, so, as might be expected, almost half of the article deals with the orchestration of Wagner’s music.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref17" href='#_ftn17'>[17]</a></p>
    <p>      In addition to Mackenzie and the journal’s editors, a significant number of the contributors to the journal were known to be admirers of Wagner or supporters of progressive trends in modern music. These included another one of the editors’ former RAM mentors, Frederick Corder, as well as Ernest Newman, Arthur Seidl and Robin Legge. For balance, there were more conservative critics among the contributors, including John S. Shedlock (who was to become editor of the <em>Athenæum</em> in 1898) and J. A. Fuller Maitland, chief music critic of <em>The Times</em>. Nonetheless, the overall progressive and (post-)Wagnerian bent of the journal is plain to see in its content. References to Wagner are found throughout the pages of the <em>New Quarterly Musical Review</em>, and ‘the master’ is nearly always considered in a positive light or defended against his critics.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref18" href='#_ftn18'>[18]</a></p>
    <p>In addition to three articles that were specifically dedicated to Wagner,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref19" href='#_ftn19'>[19]</a> Wagner’s music and aesthetic theories were invoked regularly in a series of articles on modern operas. The articles in this series were unsigned, but they bear the stamp of journal’s editor, Bantock.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref20" href='#_ftn20'>[20]</a> Wagner’s music dramas were the benchmark against which these works were judged. Thus, the conclusion to an article on Berlioz’s <em>Les Troyens</em> (1858), for instance, states that outside ‘the music-dramas of Wagner, the literature of music contains nothing approaching this score in grandeur of conception, artistic self-restraint, and nobility of style’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref21" href='#_ftn21'>[21]</a> In the context of the journal’s and its editors’ role in British musical Wagnerism, the most interesting article is the one on Stanford’s <em>The Veiled Prophet</em> (1881), which begins and ends with references to Wagner. Bantock stated at the outset that it was ‘Wagner [to whom] we owe the principles of modern dramatic form, and any work cast in that mould must necessarily be Wagnerian’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref22" href='#_ftn22'>[22]</a> Bantock opined that Stanford had found a ‘happy medium’ between music drama – in which ‘the composer is unfettered by any restraint’ – and the ‘tyrannic orthodoxy’ of opera.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref23" href='#_ftn23'>[23]</a> The article concludes with an expression of hope that there might one day be established ‘a native school of opera’, and that the <em>The Veiled Prophet</em> demonstrated that ‘the materials for its foundation are not wanting’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref24" href='#_ftn24'>[24]</a></p>
    <p>In private correspondence Bantock and Wallace were less polite about the older generation of British composers. In a letter from Bantock to Wallace in 1897, the former declared that ‘we have started a revolution, and we have a following behind us […] I agree for the present that we can well do without Parry, Stanford and Mackenzie’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref25" href='#_ftn25'>[25]</a> Similarly, Wallace wrote to his future wife, the sculptor Ottilie Helen McLaren, in February 1896:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>While we respect them [the older generation of British composers], […] we have secretly a grand contempt for all their devices […]. We are ‘the younger generation knocking at the door,’ as Ibsen says in one of his plays.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref26" href='#_ftn26'>[26]</a></p>
    </blockquote>      
    <p>As evidenced below, Bantock and Wallace construed their own music as subjective, enchanted and emotional music. By contrast, it seems that they saw in the Brahmsian music of Stanford and Parry the opposite: a disenchanted, dry academicism. They perceived Wagner’s music, in contrast to the rational logic behind Brahms’s symphonies, as emblematic of the more emotional, enchanted kind of music that they, too, wanted to create. </p>
    
    <h2>3.2 A Manifesto and a Concert at the Queen’s Hall, 1896</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">In addition to their collaboration on the <em>New Quarterly Musical Review</em>, Bantock’s and Wallace’s careers converged when they organised a concert of modern British music at the Queen’s Hall on 15 December 1896. The programme featured eight works by six British composers, including three works by Bantock, and one each by Wallace, Arthur Hinton, Stanley Hawley, Reginald Steggall and Erskine Allon – all contemporaries of Bantock and Wallace at the RAM.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref27" href='#_ftn27'>[27]</a> At the front of the analytical programme notes written by Wallace were a few paragraphs outlining the aims of the concert. The opening paragraph stated that:</p>
    <p>The chances of obtaining a hearing at the now numerous orchestral concerts in London are so remote, owing to the prevailing taste for foreign music, that the present concert is ventured upon as an experiment by several of the younger generation. While it is a coincidence that all were fellow students, any idea of a school or clique is disclaimed. The programme consists of works representative of each composer, and while it may be that the irresponsible seeker after influences may detect leanings in this or that direction, the works selected are considered sufficiently diverse in style and thought for the present purpose.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref28" href='#_ftn28'>[28]</a></p>
    <p>These remarks caused some controversy in the press, parts of which referred to them as a ‘manifesto conglomerate of erroneous statements’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref29" href='#_ftn29'>[29]</a> Responding to the various criticisms of the concert,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref30" href='#_ftn30'>[30]</a> Bantock wrote a letter to the <em>Musical News</em>, repeating the claim in the manifesto that the concert was organised for ‘the common cause of furthering the interests of British music’, and adding that ‘some of the papers have been good enough to refer to the concert as a revolutionary movement. All the better, if it is so’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref31" href='#_ftn31'>[31]</a></p>
    <p>Wallace’s pre-emptive defence against the ‘irresponsible seeker after influences’ and the ‘idea of a school or clique’ was probably in anticipation of the inevitable charge of Wagnerism.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref32" href='#_ftn32'>[32]</a> Though it would be an exaggeration to describe all the music heard at the concert as Wagnerian, the concert programme indicated the progressive, Wagnerian-Lisztian inclinations of its organisers. Almost all the works were operatic excerpts or programme music, and it is no coincidence that all six composers were educated at the New-German-School-friendly RAM.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref33" href='#_ftn33'>[33]</a> Wallace’s ‘Vocal Scena’ performed at the concert was in fact a remnant of a planned ‘music drama on the subject of “The Resurrection”’, a project of Wagnerian ambitions.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref34" href='#_ftn34'>[34]</a> The choice of such a programme, then, reflected Bantock and Wallace’s desire to launch a ‘revolutionary movement’, and made a clear statement about the path they thought modern British music should follow.</p>
    <p>Although it is Bantock who is generally recognised as the leader of the RAM-Midlands group of composers, many critics of the period identified Wallace as an equally important figure in British music. Writing in 1905, Constance Smedley wrote that the ‘modern British school’ of music was born ‘when William Wallace issued his manifesto to the critics at Queen’s Hall and when “The Passing of Beatrice” was performed. That was the tocsin of the revolution’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref35" href='#_ftn35'>[35]</a> Three years earlier, Ernest Newman assigned Wallace a similarly significant place in the history of British music:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>It is no exaggeration to say that at one time Mr. Wallace was the <em>only</em> modern English composer […]. When Englishmen were grinding away at dull pseudo-classical symphonies that are now as extinct as the dodo, Mr. Wallace was giving practical application to the truth that the only salvation for music lies in its fertilisation by some poetic idea.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref36" href='#_ftn36'>[36]</a></p>
    </blockquote>      
    <p>Newman, a key figure of British Wagnerism and, for a time, an associate of the RAM-Midlands group,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref37" href='#_ftn37'>[37]</a> highlighted an important issue when he wrote of Wallace’s recognition that ‘the only salvation for music lies in its fertilisation by some poetic idea’. This points to a fundamental aesthetic concern that united Wallace, Bantock and other British Wagnerian composers.</p>
    
    <h2>3.3 Poetic Ideas</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">Parts of an interview with Wallace that were published in the <em>Musical Standard</em> shortly after the <em>Beatrice</em> premiere shed light on Wallace’s opinions on and familiarity with Wagner’s works, and also outline his ideas regarding ‘the aesthetics of his art’. In the case of the latter, Wallace aligned himself with the ‘music of the future’, telling the <em>Musical Standard</em>’s reporter that he </p>
    <blockquote>    
      <p>regards the poetic intention as the first element in music, and thinks that if that be deep and true, the construction employed to display it will be consistent with the fundamental idea, and therefore the whole will be a work of art, because the expression of poetic emotion.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref38" href='#_ftn38'>[38]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Wallace articulated his allegiance to the Lisztian-Wagnerian tradition more clearly in a paper given to the Musical Association in 1899 on ‘The Scope of Programme Music’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref39" href='#_ftn39'>[39]</a> Wallace divided ‘programme music’ into three subcategories: there were two ‘objective’ kinds of programme music, and a third kind, ‘of infinitely greater value’, which attempted ‘to symbolize in sound ideas which are entirely subjective and appeal to the intellect, such as love, revenge, grief – all the emotions’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref40" href='#_ftn40'>[40]</a> Although Wallace’s discussion was primarily concerned with issues relating to the symphonic poem, it is not Liszt but Wagner to whom he turns to provide ‘examples of programme music so direct in their [poetic] ideas that an explanation seems unnecessary’. In the preludes to <em>Tristan</em>, <em>Lohengrin</em>, and <em>Parsifal</em> Wallace finds ‘a perfect consistency of musical workmanship’ in addition to ‘emotion of the utmost purity in thought and aim’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref41" href='#_ftn41'>[41]</a> It is no coincidence that two of the Wagnerian preludes cited by Wallace are the ones which conjure up a ‘mystical’ atmosphere, and whose influence is most clearly discernible in <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em>, a work which Wallace described as ‘more emotional than descriptive’ (thus aligning it with his third subcategory of programme music).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref42" href='#_ftn42'>[42]</a></p>
    <p>That music should be guided by ‘poetic intention’ or a ‘fundamental idea’, and be an expression of ‘emotion’, was an aesthetic concern that Wallace shared with Bantock.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref43" href='#_ftn43'>[43]</a> In 1896 Bantock expounded similar theories in an article entitled ‘The Idea in Music’, published in the <em>New Quarterly Musical Review</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref44" href='#_ftn44'>[44]</a> Like Wallace, Bantock argued that ‘All music should aim at the true expression of an Idea, conveying to the mind of the listener a similar emotion to that experienced by the composer’. Bantock goes on to define an ‘Idea’ as </p>
    <blockquote>    
      <p>the ‘act of thought on a given subject’. We may problematize it this way: – Given an Idea, to construct emotion thereon. Music being the ideal and outward effect of emotion, will depend for its true existence upon a first cause or Idea. It therefore becomes essential that every composition should bear the title of the Idea, in order that a true comprehension of the work may follow.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref45" href='#_ftn45'>[45]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Bantock contended that works labelled only as a ‘Sonata’ or a ‘Symphony’ were ‘an arid form of abstract musical thought […], meaningless unless accompanied by the presentment of the Idea’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref46" href='#_ftn46'>[46]</a> Cast in opposition to these ‘ascetic forms of Classicism’ is the ‘romantic with its Idea’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref47" href='#_ftn47'>[47]</a> Music guided by the Idea is associated with ‘the progress of Art’, ‘the liberal spirit evinced by the younger generation of musicians’, and with composers such as Berlioz, Liszt, and Wagner, who are all lauded in the course of the article. As in Wallace’s writings, it is Wagner’s music that receives especially high praise in the article for providing us with an ‘Idea’ to follow.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref48" href='#_ftn48'>[48]</a></p>
    <p>      Directly or indirectly, these ideas about Ideas and poetic intentions came down to Bantock and Wallace from the figureheads of the New German School. Liszt discussed the significance of the ‘poetic idea’ in various writings,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref49" href='#_ftn49'>[49]</a> while Wagner used the term ‘poetic intent’ (<em>dichterische Absicht</em>), a concept employed at various points in <em>Opera and Drama</em> (1851), to refer to ‘the essential conceptual “truths” that the poet-dramatist seeks to convey’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref50" href='#_ftn50'>[50]</a> Thomas Grey explains that when discussing the ‘realization’ of poetic intent, Wagner emphasised the need for the ‘verbal, rational element to disappear or “dissolve” in music’, so that the idea may be ‘received on a purely emotional level by its audience’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref51" href='#_ftn51'>[51]</a> Or, as Dahlhaus puts it, for the Wagner of <em>Opera and Drama</em> the ‘function of musical expression’ was</p>
    <blockquote>    
      <p>to present the creative artist’s initial and underlying idea not merely to the intellect or understanding but directly to a region of perception where instinct and the emotions together recognize the truth in the evidence presented by the senses.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref52" href='#_ftn52'>[52]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="first-para-section">Wallace echoes Wagner, then, when he writes that a composer’s interpretation of a poetic idea ‘cannot be analysed by the faculty of reason since it appeals primarily to our emotions’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref53" href='#_ftn53'>[53]</a></p>
    <p>It is clear from the compositional outputs of both Wallace and Bantock that they put their theories into practice. Aside from some incidental music for the theatre and a number of songs, Wallace’s output was made up almost entirely of orchestral works which indicated their ‘poetic ideas’ through their titles. Most of these works were labelled by Wallace as symphonic poems, but there were also rhapsodies, overtures, preludes, suites, and fantasies, which take their inspiration from sources as wide ranging as the Bible, Goethe, Shakespeare, Rossetti, Maeterlinck, and Dante.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref54" href='#_ftn54'>[54]</a> Compared with that of Wallace, Bantock’s output was far larger and more diverse: in addition to six numbered tone poems composed between 1899 and 1902, his 1890s compositions include three operas (one unfinished), various programmatic orchestral works, and a number of large-scale works for chorus and orchestra. Like Wallace, then, Bantock composed almost no ‘absolute’ music at all during this stage of his career, and his poetic intent was always indicated, as he argued it should be, by his works’ programmatic titles.</p>
    
    <h2>3.4 Wallace’s <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em>, Pre-Raphaelitism and Wagnerian Mysticism</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">Although Wallace’s compositional career lasted little more than two decades,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref55" href='#_ftn55'>[55]</a> and he composed far fewer works during that period than Bantock, he deserves credit for being the first British composer to take the genre of the symphonic poem seriously. Wallace’s six numbered symphonic poems, beginning with <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em> in 1892 and ending with <em>Villon</em> in 1909, arguably paved the way for the later ventures in the genre by British composers such as Bantock, Holbrooke and Bax.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref56" href='#_ftn56'>[56]</a> <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em> is remarkable not only for being the first notable British work in the genre, but also for being a significant milestone in the history of British Wagnerism that anticipated the Wagnerian mystical religiosity of Elgar’s <em>Gerontius</em>. Moreover, the present chapter will suggest that Wallace’s work also developed an aspect of British Wagnerism that had already been introduced in the libretto of Parry’s <em>Guenever</em>: the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites and their proto-decadent aesthetics.</p>
    <p>      <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em> was also one of the first works in which Wallace put his theories about ‘poetic ideas’ into practice. The ‘poetic’ inspiration for the work is indicated on the front of the published full score, which displays three lines from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s translation of Dante Alighieri’s <em>Paradiso</em>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In fashion then as of a snow-white rose</p>
      <p>Displayed itself to me the saintly host,</p>
      <p>Whom Christ in his own blood had made his bride.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This is the beginning of the thirty-first of thirty-three cantos that constitute the third and final canticle of Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em> (<em>Divina Commedia</em>, 1321). The lines quoted by Wallace are drawn from the climax of the entire epic. The white rose, symbolic of ‘purity, beauty, chastity, and perfection’, is used by Dante to describe his heavenly vision of the souls of the blessed who appear to him as concentric rows of petals.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref57" href='#_ftn57'>[57]</a></p>
    <p>Wallace’s programme notes for an 1899 performance of <em>Beatrice</em> at one of Bantock’s New Brighton Tower concerts provide further details of the composer’s intentions:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="first-para-section">This Symphonic Poem deals with an episode which Dante refers to very slightly, and is designed to illustrate the passing or transition of Beatrice from earthly to immortal form. </p>
      <p>Dante and Beatrice are taken up into the Empyrean. Paradise opens before them in the form of a snow-white Rose, within whose petals he descries [<em>sic</em>] ‘The saintly host whom Christ in his own blood had made his bride.’ Dante is lost in amazement at the vision, and in turning to question Beatrice, finds that she is no longer by his side, but has passed through space to take her seat within the Rose.</p>
      <p>The music begins with a phrase which represents the Rose, and the first section of the music is limited to the development of it. The second section opens with wood-wind alone, and is devoted to music which represents the transformation of the earthly love of Dante for Beatrice into the heavenly love described in the poem. Two phases are here employed, one to signify ‘longing,’ and the other ‘love.’ These are subjected to various modifications, and, after the introduction of a chorale, the music dies away as the vision is supposed to fade from Dante’s sight.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref58" href='#_ftn58'>[58]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Wallace’s work should also be seen in the context of other nineteenth-century artworks inspired by both Dante’s <em>magnum opus</em> and his autobiographical work <em>La Vita Nuova</em> (<em>The New Life</em>, 1295).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref59" href='#_ftn59'>[59]</a> The most notable of these works in the musical sphere was Liszt’s <em>Dante</em> Symphony (premiered in 1857), based on the first two parts of the <em>Comedy</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref60" href='#_ftn60'>[60]</a> As an admirer of Liszt, Wallace might well have viewed his own symphonic poem as a continuation of Liszt’s work. Unlike Liszt’s Symphony, however, which includes inscriptions from Dante’s poem in the score and contains various episodes that evoke specific passages from the <em>Comedy</em>, <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em> takes its main inspiration from only a brief moment of the <em>Paradiso</em>. In fact, Beatrice’s actual transformation from material to divine form is not described at all.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref61" href='#_ftn61'>[61]</a> The ‘passing’ that Wallace’s music is intended to illustrate occurs only in between the lines of Dante’s poem: <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em> is a temporalisation of an imperceptible moment that lies at the boundary between the material and the immaterial, between time and eternity. Consequently, <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em> invites comparison with a pictorial representation of the mystical transfiguration of Dante’s Beatrice by one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828–82), in his oil painting <em>Beata Beatrix</em> (‘Blessed Beatrice’, 1864–70; Fig. 3.1).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref62" href='#_ftn62'>[62]</a></p>
    
    <h3>3.4.1 Two Dantes and Pre-Raphaelite Wagnerism</h3>
    <p class="first-para-section">Beginning in the 1840s, Rossetti was occupied for a number of years with a translation of Dante’s <em>La Vita Nuova</em>, which was eventually published in 1861.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref63" href='#_ftn63'>[63]</a> The appeal of the thirteenth-century poet to the nineteenth-century Rossetti operated on several levels: Dante was one of many medieval sources of inspiration for the Pre-Raphaelites; Rossetti frequently aligned his own life with Dante’s and drew parallels between the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood as a whole and the medieval circle of Dante and the <em>dolce stil novo</em> poets;&#8288;<a id="_ftnref64" href='#_ftn64'>[64]</a> and, above all, Rossetti’s imagination was gripped by Dante’s unrequited love for Beatrice. The figure of Beatrice, representative of a sort of ideal love, at once both erotic and religious, had a particularly strong impact on Rossetti, and she became the ‘prototype of almost all [his] female figures’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref65" href='#_ftn65'>[65]</a> Isobel Armstrong argues that Rossetti derived from Dante and his work on <em>La Vita Nuova</em> a sort of ‘sacramental eroticism’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref66" href='#_ftn66'>[66]</a></p>

    </div> 

    <p>Rossetti’s fascination with Dante and Beatrice led to a number of paintings in which one or both figures are the main subjects,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref67" href='#_ftn67'>[67]</a> and one of the most famous of these is <em>Beata Beatrix</em> (Fig. 3.1). The painting was, in part, a response to the death of Rossetti’s wife, Elizabeth Siddall, in 1862. Siddall was the model for a number of Pre-Raphaelite paintings and her image was also the inspiration for <em>Beata Beatrix</em>. Rossetti described the painting as follows:</p>
    <p>The picture must of course be viewed not as a representation of the incident of the death of Beatrice, but as an ideal of the subject, symbolised by a trance or sudden spiritual transfiguration. Beatrice is rapt visibly into Heaven, seeing as it were through her shut lids (as Dante says at the close of Vita Nuova): ‘Him who is blessed throughout all ages’; and in sign of the supreme change, the radiant bird, a messenger of death, drops the white poppy between her open hands. In the background is the City, which, as Dante says: ‘sat solitary’ in mourning for her death; and through whose street Dante himself is seen to pass gazing towards the figure of Love opposite, in whose hand the waning life of his lady flickers as a flame. On the sundial at her side the shadow falls on the hour of nine, which number Dante connects mystically in many ways with her and with her death.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref68" href='#_ftn68'>[68]</a></p>
    <p>Ferderic George Stephens, an art critic and one of the original seven members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, wrote of the ‘mysticism and mystery’ of <em>Beata Beatrix</em>, describing it as ‘dream-like, and of a dream’. It is ‘dream-like’ because the outwardly static image of Beatrice’s head tilting towards the sky is surrounded by a ‘celestial light’ producing a heavenly glow around her hair – a ‘saint-like halo’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref69" href='#_ftn69'>[69]</a> Robert Upstone has also observed that the ‘hazy, unfocused quality’ of the painting adds to its ‘visionary, dream-like, transcendent character’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref70" href='#_ftn70'>[70]</a> The painting was ‘Of a dream’, on the other hand, because behind her closed eyes Beatrice experiences, inwardly, ‘heavenly visions of the New Life’ at the moment of her spiritual transfiguration.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref71" href='#_ftn71'>[71]</a></p>
    <p>      In addition to the mystical-spiritual character of the painting, there is an erotic aspect of <em>Beata Beatrix</em>, emphasised by Beatrice’s sensuous open red lips. Upstone writes that Rossetti ‘evidently intends to suggest a connection between the sexual and the divine, between orgasm and revelation’. <em>Beata Beatrix</em>, then, clearly exhibits the kind of ‘sacramental eroticism’ mentioned above. According to Tim Barringer, Rossetti’s painting also implies ‘a connection between the vision of death and the state of sexual ecstasy’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref72" href='#_ftn72'>[72]</a> The intersection of the themes of sex, death, and religious experience suggests parallels with the work of Wagner. While there is no causal connection between Rossetti’s work and Wagner’s, there is clearly a similarity between the ‘sacramental eroticism’ of <em>Beata Beatrix</em>, the ‘erotic religiosity’ of <em>Parsifal</em> and the climactic love-death in <em>Tristan</em>. Robin Holloway has suggested that Wagner was striving for a similar effect to that of Pre-Raphaelite work in ‘<em>Tristan</em> and <em>Parsifal</em>, with their Romance stories and fusion of fleshly and spiritual elements’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref73" href='#_ftn73'>[73]</a></p>
    <p>As Anne Dzamba Sessa has pointed out, there were also strong personal connections between Pre-Raphaelite and British Wagnerian circles (see also Chapter 1).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref74" href='#_ftn74'>[74]</a> The music critic and Wagnerite Francis Hueffer, for instance, was a good friend of Rossetti and he married the daughter of Ford Madox Brown, another artist associated with the Pre-Raphaelites.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref75" href='#_ftn75'>[75]</a> Edward Dannreuther was also an admirer of Pre-Raphaelite art, and, like Hueffer, set some Pre-Raphaelite verse to music in 1884.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref76" href='#_ftn76'>[76]</a> Although Rossetti apparently regarded music as a ‘noisy nuisance’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref77" href='#_ftn77'>[77]</a> John Everett Millais, another founder of the Brotherhood, appreciated the ‘modern romantic school of music’ and particularly liked Wagner, whom he met and was impressed by during the composer’s visit to London in 1877.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref78" href='#_ftn78'>[78]</a> Edward Burne-Jones also admired Wagner’s music and sketched Cosima Wagner in his studio in 1877.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref79" href='#_ftn79'>[79]</a> The Pre-Raphaelites’ links with poets and artists such as Swinburne and Beardsley also points to the role of their art as a precursor to the decadent movement that flourished in the last two decades of the century. As the nineteenth century progressed and the original members of the Brotherhood pursued different artistic directions, the work of Rossetti and his circle in the 1860s became increasingly focussed on erotic subjects and with the image of an ideal, eroticised woman or group of women.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref80" href='#_ftn80'>[80]</a> It was precisely these sorts of images that led to some Pre-Raphaelite art being described as ‘fleshly’. Dennis Denisoff argues that it was in large part this ‘fleshliness’ that constituted the Pre-Raphaelites’ contribution to an early branch of aestheticism and decadence whose influence continues to persist in certain later, more overtly decadent images drawn by Beardsley.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref81" href='#_ftn81'>[81]</a> The link between Pre-Raphaelitism and decadence was further reinforced in the minds of contemporary critics by the perception that their work was in some respects ‘Catholic’ or in keeping with the spirit of the Oxford Movement.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref82" href='#_ftn82'>[82]</a> Catholicism, as Ellis Hanson explains, was ‘central to both the stylistic peculiarities and the thematic preoccupations of the decadents’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref83" href='#_ftn83'>[83]</a></p>
    <p>The strong connections between Rossetti’s proto-decadent phase of Pre-Raphaelite art and Wagnerism emerged, too, in Wallace’s <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em>. There are a number of similarities between Wallace’s work and <em>Beata Beatrix</em>: they share a mystical, transcendent character; both depict Beatrice at the moment of her ‘spiritual transfiguration’, as Rossetti put it, or ‘passing’, as Wallace put it; and they both combine ‘earthly’ and ‘heavenly’ ideas of love. While these parallels might be dismissed as coincidence, evidence suggests that Wallace probably knew and appreciated Rossetti’s painting. Wallace had a passion for the visual arts,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref84" href='#_ftn84'>[84]</a> and his specific interest in Rossetti is demonstrated by his later symphonic poem <em>Sister Helen</em> (1897), based on a ballad by Rossetti. Like <em>Beata Beatrix</em>, the ballad exhibits some decadent characteristics: Sister Helen is a <em>femme fatale</em> who brings about the death of her former lover by burning a wax model of him.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref85" href='#_ftn85'>[85]</a> <em>Beata Beatrix</em> was displayed in the National Gallery from 1889, so it is likely that Wallace, who lived in London from 1888, saw the painting before he composed <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em>. His remarks about the translatability of artworks from one medium to another support the possibility that Rossetti’s painting shaped Wallace’s treatment of the subject: ‘everyone can translate into his own tongue the work of others’, Wallace wrote, ‘absorb it till pictures appear as symphonies, and symphonies as sculpture’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref86" href='#_ftn86'>[86]</a></p>
    <p>      Rossetti and Wallace also shared an aesthetic interest in the idea of ‘inwardness’. Wallace, for example, once wrote that ‘The great difficulty when translating an idea which can be put into words into music to be played only, is that one may miss all the “inwardness” and try to catch the externals only’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref87" href='#_ftn87'>[87]</a> This complements Wallace’s preference for ‘emotional’ rather than ‘descriptive’ programme music: he wanted his music to convey subjective, emotional ideas, not merely outward details.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref88" href='#_ftn88'>[88]</a> Richard Langham Smith has remarked upon the ‘inner action’ (or ‘inner drama’) of Rossetti’s poetry and visual art, pointing in particular to Rossetti’s drawing <em>St. Cecilia</em> (1859), an illustration for Tennyson’s poem ‘The Palace of Art’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref89" href='#_ftn89'>[89]</a> The drawing’s central female figure is strikingly similar to the Beatrice of <em>Beata Beatrix</em>: an eroticised, long-haired Pre-Raphaelite woman, with her head tilted backwards and eyes shut. Smith’s description of the illustration could equally apply to the later painting: ‘a static scene pregnant with inner action, drawn inward by the form, the closed eyes and concealed face’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref90" href='#_ftn90'>[90]</a> Wallace’s <em>Beatrice</em> is shaped by a similar aesthetic: the programme is not a sequence of actions but rather an outwardly static scene.</p>
    <p>By combining late, proto-decadent Pre-Raphaelite aesthetics with elements of a Wagnerian musical language in the <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em>, Wallace created a fashionable yet still respectable <em>fin-de-siècle</em> form of British musical Wagnerism. Emma Sutton has suggested that the distinction between ‘“respectable” Pre-Raphaelite aestheticism’ and ‘outré decadence’, and between ‘orthodox’ and ‘decadent Wagnerism’ is often ‘nebulous’, but it is nonetheless a useful one.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref91" href='#_ftn91'>[91]</a> Wallace certainly did not want his own or Wagner’s music to be associated with outré decadence, understood in a negative sense. In an article entitled ‘Music and Pessimism’, published in the <em>New Quarterly Musical Review</em> in February 1894, he set out to dissociate ‘modern music’ from decadence and accusations that it was morbid, unhealthy, and unnatural.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref92" href='#_ftn92'>[92]</a> According to Wallace, <em>fin-de-siècle</em> society was not in decay or ‘on the brink of disaster’, and modern music did not reflect such a deteriorating world. Wallace’s intention, as he made clear to the <em>Musical News</em> after they had published a misleading review of his article, was to argue that ‘music is clean’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref93" href='#_ftn93'>[93]</a></p>
    <p>Referring specifically to Berlioz and Wagner, Wallace stated that ‘There may be excitement […] in listening to these prophets of modern music, but it is healthy, and health-giving. It is not enervating, nor does it encourage a depraved taste’. Listening to Wagner’s <em>Ring</em> did not, Wallace argued, bring about the degeneration of civilisation but rather nothing ‘other than what is noble and hopeful’. He concluded by explaining that ‘instead of being levelled down, we are being levelled up’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref94" href='#_ftn94'>[94]</a> Here Wallace reveals his strong interest in evolutionary ideas about music which he later set out more clearly in his books.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref95" href='#_ftn95'>[95]</a> Like other British Wagnerians who were influenced by nineteenth-century writings about evolution (Parry, Hueffer, Newman) Wallace viewed Wagner as the culmination of centuries of musical evolution, not the cause of <em>fin-de-siècle</em> degeneration.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref96" href='#_ftn96'>[96]</a></p>
    
    <h3>3.4.2 Wagnerian Music and Wagnerian Mysticism</h3>
    <p class="first-para-section">The Wagnerian aspects of <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em> are apparent in the technical workings of the music, the subject matter (or ‘poetic ideas’), and the mystical atmosphere of the work. None of this went unnoticed by the press after the premiere and subsequent performances. George Bernard Shaw praised Wallace’s ‘tender and sympathetic talent’, but wrote that ‘the prelude to Lohengrin [was] an instance of the successful accomplishment of what Mr Wallace tries to do in his poem, which, if cut down by about nine-tenths, and well worked over, would make a pretty <em>entr’acte</em>’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref97" href='#_ftn97'>[97]</a> Other critics remarked that Wallace was ‘evidently an ardent Wagnerite’ or ‘a devout student and worshipper of Wagner’,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref98" href='#_ftn98'>[98]</a> and they considered his symphonic poem to be ‘inordinately Wagnerian’, ‘ultra-Wagnerian’, ‘intensely Wagnerian’, and ‘surcharged with Wagnerism’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref99" href='#_ftn99'>[99]</a></p>
    <p>      The critic for the <em>London Standard</em> wrote that Wallace had ‘sought inspiration from <em>Tristan und Isolde</em> and <em>Parsifal</em>, and in a lesser degree from <em>Tannhäuser</em>’, supporting this observation by pointing to a number of ‘Wagnerian’ musical characteristics in Wallace’s symphonic poem: ‘Meandering progressions, chiefly in chromatic chords, and themes deficient both in rhythmic scoring and clear tonality’; some kind of sonata form that was ‘difficult […] to follow [with] its wanderings among related and unrelated keys’; and ‘modern orchestration’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref100" href='#_ftn100'>[100]</a> Others remarked on similar Wagnerian tendencies to be found in the work’s ‘thematic structure and treatment of the orchestra’, its ‘harmonies and progressions’, the ‘Wagnerian absence of melody and “tune”’, a ‘vagueness of tonality [and] want of rhythm’, a chorale-like theme ‘“blared” by the brasses in the true Wagnerian style’, and ‘Wagnerian […] phraseology, full closes being almost as conspicuous by their absence as in the Prelude to “Tristan and Isolde”’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref101" href='#_ftn101'>[101]</a></p>
    <p>      Wallace’s comments in his interview with the <em>Musical Standard</em> that took place after the premiere show that he had no concerns about ‘the charge of being a votary of Wagner’s’:</p>
    <blockquote>    
      <p>Mr. Wallace asks the pertinent question, ‘Who is not?’ But his reading of Wagner has been limited. It is six years since he heard ‘Tannhäuser,’ and three since he heard ‘Lohengrin.’ He heard the ‘Ring’ and ‘Tristan’ this summer, and of course he is familiar with the various concert pieces arranged from the dramas. He has the full scores of the ‘Lohengrin,’ and ‘Meistersinger’ overtures. <em>Voila tout!</em> But those who consider Wagner a Dangerous Guide for a Young Composer to follow will regret to learn that it is Mr. Wallace’s intention to study deeply the works of the Bayreuth master.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref102" href='#_ftn102'>[102]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="first-para-section">The music of <em>Beatrice</em> indicates Wallace’s familiarity not just with <em>Lohengrin</em>, but also with <em>Tristan</em> and <em>Parsifal</em>. Beyond the purely technical aspects of the music, <em>Beatrice</em>’s Wagnerism can be attributed to the general character and atmosphere conveyed by the piece, described by contemporary critics as ‘soft and yearning’, ‘gentle and dreamy’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref103" href='#_ftn103'>[103]</a> W. A. R. of the <em>Musical News</em> wrote of the work’s ‘ethereal atmosphere’ which was ‘undeniably appropriate’ for the ‘mystical subject’ it was meant to express.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref104" href='#_ftn104'>[104]</a> Indeed, if there is one word that most effectively captures the mood of Wallace’s symphonic poem, and which links it with its Wagnerian precursors it would be ‘mystical’.</p>
    <p>Wagner – and especially <em>Parsifal –</em> was often linked with mysticism at the <em>fin de siècle</em>, in both a negative and a positive light.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref105" href='#_ftn105'>[105]</a> In Francis Hueffer’s 1872 article on Wagner for the <em>Fortnightly Review</em>, for example, he wrote of the ‘religious ecstasy’ and ‘sublime harmonies’ of the prelude to <em>Lohengrin</em>: ‘never have the sweetness and shudderings of Christian mysticism been more fully realised than in this triumph of instrumental music’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref106" href='#_ftn106'>[106]</a> Ashton Ellis also wrote at length about Wagner’s mysticism in the 1880s, though in his case mysticism was always viewed through the lens of Theosophy and occultism. According to Ellis, we find in Wagner’s works ‘plots thickset with mysticism and bristling with magic’. <em>Parsifal</em>, Ellis believed, was the ‘most clearly mystic of them’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref107" href='#_ftn107'>[107]</a> Wallace himself later wrote that Wagner had ‘encompassed’ <em>Parsifal</em> with a ‘mystical […] fabric’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref108" href='#_ftn108'>[108]</a></p>
    <p>While in <em>Parsifal</em> the key aspect of mysticism is the mystical union that the protagonist experiences near the end of the second act,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref109" href='#_ftn109'>[109]</a> the mysticism of <em>Lohengrin</em>, described in Wagner’s programme for its prelude, is related to the vision of the ‘miraculous descent of the Grail accompanied by the host of angels’ and the awe of the mortal onlookers.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref110" href='#_ftn110'>[110]</a> Wallace’s programme notes for <em>Beatrice</em> suggest that his work appeals to both of these kinds of mysticism: on the one hand there is a mystical vision (Dante is ‘lost in amazement at the vision’ of the White Rose), as in Wagner’s programme for the prelude to <em>Lohengrin</em>; on the other hand, Beatrice’s transition to ‘immortal form’ indicates a mystical union of indistinction whereby Beatrice becomes one with God and the souls in the White Rose.</p>
    <p>If the mystical aspects of Wallace’s programme share characteristics with both <em>Lohengrin</em> and <em>Parsifal</em>, his musical representation of the mystical combines elements from the preludes to both. In fact, Wallace’s music contains a number of musical signifiers that form part of a Wagnerian mystical ‘topic’, for which the preludes to <em>Lohengrin</em> and <em>Parsifal</em> serve as paradigmatic examples. Characteristics of this topic include an emphasis on the higher registers, which creates an ethereal atmosphere; unison or solo melodies at the beginning of a work; the incorporation of existing religious melodies from hymns, chorales or plainchants; passages that more generally suggest hymn- or chorale-like textures; a fade-in and fade-out effect at the opening and close respectively of a section of music, suggesting perhaps a divine vision that appears, intensifies and fades from sight; and inspiration stemming from mystical subject matter, particularly themes where there are associations with Catholicism and an emphasis on spiritual or heavenly ‘love’. All of these features, in some form, appear in <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em>.</p>
    <p>The opening music of <em>Beatrice</em> (Ex. 3.1), which represents the opening of the Rose according to Wallace’s programme, alludes to the beginning of <em>Parsifal</em> through its dotted rhythm that leads to a repeated note and its solemn rising unison melody.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref111" href='#_ftn111'>[111]</a> Moreover the initial obfuscation of the metre – engendered by the first note’s placement on the second beat of the bar, the tie across the barline and the gentle syncopations of the answering phrase beginning in bar 6 – contributes to a sense of timelessness, as does the absence of bass instruments.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref112" href='#_ftn112'>[112]</a> Such timelessness, a characteristic typical of representations of the mystical, is evoked in a similar way at the start of <em>Parsifal</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref113" href='#_ftn113'>[113]</a> The end of <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em> (Ex. 3.2), depicting the fading of Dante’s mystical vision, alludes to the end of the prelude to <em>Lohengrin</em>, which also represents the dying away of a mystical vision (the angels’ return to the ‘celestial ether’). Musically, this effect is achieved in both works through the use of strings vanishing into ever higher registers, creating an effect analogous with the ethereal shimmering light associated with Dante’s and Wagner’s mystical imagery.</p>

    <p>These Wagnerian allusions not only help to translate the mystical, spiritual aspects of Wallace’s official programme into music, but they could also be seen to parallel the religious aspects of Rossetti’s <em>Beata Beatrix</em>. The <em>pianissimo</em> solemnity of the opening music is comparable with Beatrice’s inward spiritual transfiguration, while the shimmering solo violins at the end of Wallace’s work resemble the halo-like glow surrounding the hair of Rossetti’s Beatrice. Wallace’s use of a chorale-like theme (Ex. 3.3), which acts as a kind of secondary subject, also adds to the religious dimension of the music. The closing two bars of the theme are taken from Jacques Arcadelt’s 1554 song <em>Nous voyons que les hommes</em>, the tune of which was later arranged with the words of the <em>Ave Maria</em> by Pierre-Louis Dietsch in 1842.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref114" href='#_ftn114'>[114]</a> Whichever version Wallace knew, his quotation of this Renaissance music was perhaps intended to convey a sense of Dante’s historical time and place, just as the background of Rossetti’s painting displays Florence’s Ponte Vecchio. Even though Arcadelt’s music was composed a few centuries after Dante, Wallace might have nonetheless been satisfied with the vague sense of historical colour that it contributed.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref115" href='#_ftn115'>[115]</a></p>

    </div> 

    <p>More significant is the element of eroticism that Wallace’s music shares with Rossetti’s painting, and which Wallace again conveyed through the use of Wagnerian musical language and allusions. Specifically, <em>Beatrice</em> alludes in various ways to the music of <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>. The motifs that Wallace described as ‘longing’ and ‘love’, for instance, employ <em>Tristan</em>-esque chromaticisms, suspensions and sighing appoggiaturas, and the motif of ‘longing’, a word which itself has Wagnerian connotations, emphasises the erotic <em>Tristan</em> connections by way of a Tristan chord (highlighted in Ex. 3.4).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref116" href='#_ftn116'>[116]</a> Shortly after the first statements of each of these themes, there is a modified version of the ‘longing’ motif that alludes to the so-called ‘Blickmotiv’ from the prelude to <em>Tristan</em> (Exx. 3.5 and 3.6). The music is similar to Wagner’s in terms of its general melodic contour, the pizzicato bass that emphasises the downbeats and the rising sequential motion which in Wallace’s work takes the form of a series of interrupted tonicisations.</em></p>

    <caption><strong>Example 3.4</strong> Wallace, <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em>, fig. G:1–6, ‘longing’ motif</caption>

    </div> 

    <p>The music based on the ‘longing’ motif could well have been intended to depict the ‘earthly’ (that is, erotic) love that Wallace referred to in his programme, whereas the ‘love’ motif (Ex. 3.7) was perhaps associated with the programme’s ‘heavenly’ love. The combination of erotic and heavenly love, which are at once opposed and yet fundamentally intertwined with each other is a typically Wagnerian characteristic: Laurence Dreyfus notes that ‘until the end of his days […] Wagner continued to modulate between two musico-erotic themes—the idealistic, Romantic vision of love the redeemer and the darkly obsessive vision of sex as curse’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref117" href='#_ftn117'>[117]</a> It is telling that in Wallace’s score it is the (heavenly) ‘love’ motif that forms the basis for the climax at fig. P in the orchestral score, corresponding with the programme’s instruction that the earthly love transforms to heavenly love – the redeeming love triumphs over the erotic. Nonetheless the ‘longing’ motif continues to be heard in various forms until the end of the piece, suggesting that the distinction between the two kinds of love is not so straightforward.</p>

      <img src="/images/chapter3/ex3_7.webp" alt="Placeholder">
    </div> 

    <p>In combining these two kinds of love, Wallace achieved musically what Rossetti achieved pictorially in <em>Beata Beatrix</em>. Moreover, in fusing the mystical musical language of <em>Parsifal</em> and <em>Lohengrin</em> with the erotic musical language of <em>Tristan</em>, Wallace evoked the atmosphere of both Rossetti’s ‘sacramental eroticism’ and the ‘erotic religiosity’ of that would later appear in Elgar’s <em>Gerontius</em>. Although there is no explicit evidence to confirm that Wallace was attempting a transmedialisation of <em>Beata Beatrix</em>, considering the two artworks in tandem reveals that the apparently decadent aspects of <em>fin-de-siècle</em> British musical Wagnerism were closely related to, if not directly shaped by, a late phase of Pre-Raphaelitism that, in its fusion of the fleshly and the spiritual, converged with Wagnerian themes.</p>

    <h2>3.5 Bantock’s <em>Caedmar</em>, Wagner, and the Re-enchantment of Nature</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">While Wallace sought to build on Wagner’s legacy in the Lisztian genre of the symphonic poem, Bantock, in one of his earliest and most Wagnerian works, chose the riskier option of competing with Wagner directly in his own genre of music drama. Two years before the premiere of <em>Caedmar</em> – Bantock’s first opera – the composer articulated his Wagnerian ambitions in an article for the RAM’s student journal, <em>The Overture</em>. In the article, published under the Wagnerian title of ‘The Music-Drama of the Future’, Bantock praised Wagner for creating ‘the first perfect ideal Music-drama’ in the form of <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref118" href='#_ftn118'>[118]</a> But he also criticised ‘the unnecessary and tiresome recitative with which Wagner cramps all his works’ and argued that the music drama of the future should follow a new path. In fact, Bantock’s vision of a future music drama was very similar to Wagner’s: it would use a ‘concealed orchestra’ that would ‘intensify and interpret the dramatic situation’; it would be based on ‘mythical or legendary lore’; and it would use a ‘[leit]motive-system’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref119" href='#_ftn119'>[119]</a> In other respects, Bantock’s proposal differed from Wagner: he suggested a drama of five acts, each twenty or thirty minutes in duration, linked by interludes of about ten minutes which would commence ‘at once on the fall of the curtain, or even before and ceasing when or after the curtain has risen’; there would be no intervals so that ‘the audience would exist in the presence of an ideal world, the continuity of which would not be broken for a moment’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref120" href='#_ftn120'>[120]</a></p>
    <p>      By the time Bantock composed the music of <em>Caedmar</em>, for which he also wrote the libretto, he must have either changed his views on the future of music drama or decided that the kind of five-act performance he was proposing was impractical. The title page of the vocal score of <em>Caedmar</em>, which includes a dedication to Bantock’s Wagnerian mentor, Frederick Corder, describes the work as a ‘Romantic Opera in One Act’. As it was in only one act, <em>Caedmar</em> did in fact maintain the continuity of the ‘ideal world’ that Bantock proposed two years earlier, but it involves no ten-minute interludes. Bantock also adhered to his theories by employing leitmotifs in his opera and by providing it with a vaguely legendary setting, though the libretto is not based on any specific mythological source. Bantock describes the setting of the opera at the front of the score:</p>
    <blockquote>    
      <p>A forest of Inistore [Orkney] in ancient Britain. In the centre an open glade, across which lies the trunk of a fallen tree. Around are tall trees, and bushes on either side. At the back, dark and gloomy. It is evening, and the sun has just set, a faint red glow being discernible in the sky above. It gradually dies away, and the moon rises lighting up the glade.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref121" href='#_ftn121'>[121]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Despite his suggestion in the 1890 article that the author of the music drama of the future should to some extent ‘separate himself from Wagner’, Bantock did the opposite by clearly aligning his work with Wagner both musically and dramatically (see Appendix I for a synopsis of the libretto). The parallels with Wagner did not go unnoticed by the contemporary critics. They pointed out the usual ‘Wagnerian’ aspects of the music: its orchestration, ‘continuous’ music, avoidance of ‘formal melodies and cadences’, and unstable tonality.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref122" href='#_ftn122'>[122]</a> There are a number of recurring motifs throughout the opera which suggest Bantock was attempting to emulate Wagner’s leitmotivic technique, but most of these recurring ideas do not undergo extensive development and do not permeate the texture of the music in the way that Wagner’s letimotifs do. Many of these motifs function more like reminiscence motifs, but an important exception to this is the motif associated with Caedmar that appears at the very opening of the work and is pervasive throughout. This rising scale and dotted rhythms that characterise the ‘Caedmar’ motif (Ex. 3.8; the melody in the opening 8 bars) suggest a chivalrous rhetoric found, too, in the works of Elgar and Parry, and this complements the chivalrous actions of the errant knight during the opera.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref123" href='#_ftn123'>[123]</a></p>
    <p>Even more than the Wagnerian musical language of <em>Caedmar</em>, the critics of the work were keen to point out the dramatic similarities between Bantock’s opera and Wagner’s music dramas. George Bernard Shaw thought the ‘whole affair’ to be ‘absurdly second-hand’, and yet proved ‘remarkable musical ability on the part of Mr Granville Bantock’. The opera was </p>
    <blockquote>    
      <p>nothing less than an adaption of all the most fetching passages in Wagner’s later tragic music-dramas to a little poem in which Tristan, Siegmund, Siegfried, Hunding, Isolde, and Sieglinde are aptly concentrated into three persons. The idea is an excellent one; for in the space of an hour, and within a stone’s-throw of the Strand, we get the cream of all Bayreuth without the trouble and expense of journeying thither.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref124" href='#_ftn124'>[124]</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    </div> 
    
    <p>The opera’s eponymous hero is an amalgamation of Siegmund, Siegfried, and Tristan; the heroine, Hulda, is a mixture of Sieglinde and Isolde; and the villain, Andred, is Hunding with shades of Alberich.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref125" href='#_ftn125'>[125]</a> <em>Die Walküre</em> seems to have served as the principal model for the scenario of <em>Caedmar</em>, but the influence of <em>Siegfried</em> and <em>Tristan</em> is also apparent at some of the work’s important moments. The parallels with <em>Die</em> <em>Walküre</em> include the mistreated wife who meets a stranger and falls in love with him, the figure of the one-dimensional hunter husband, the sword fight between the hero (the tenor) and the villain (the bass), and the opposition between genuine, free love and the corrupt institution of marriage. </p>
    <p>In addition to a <em>Tristan</em>-esque love duet in the centre of the opera, Bantock seems to have looked to <em>Tristan</em> for the opera’s peroration that depicts the death (‘as if transfigured’) of one of the lovers and the uniting of their souls. Unlike in <em>Tristan</em>, however, it is Hulda, the female protagonist, who dies first, while Caedmar is left to sing the final monologue. And despite the transcendent aspirations evident in Caedmar’s closing words (‘All freed from pain / To live again / In endless pure delight’) there is not an extended ‘Liebestod’ like that of <em>Tristan</em>. The fact that Caedmar kneels down and prays to ‘heaven’ suggests a more conventional religious conception of an afterlife that contrasts with the Schopenhauerian dissolution into oneness at the end of <em>Tristan</em>. Moreover, Caedmar does not drop dead at the end, as Isolde does, but rather ‘still lives on earth’, despite the fact that, according to the directions at the end of the score, his soul ‘is with Hulda above’:</p>
    <blockquote>    
      <p>the back opens and in flood [<em>sic</em>] of light discloses Hulda’s spirit form bending lovingly over Caedmar, who kneels at her feet, signifying that though Caedmar still lives on earth; yet his soul is with Hulda above. With a crash the vision disappears, and daylight dawns as the curtain descends.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If there is a Wagnerian precedent for this vision it is the conclusion of <em>Der fliegende Holländer</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref126" href='#_ftn126'>[126]</a> In terms of the music, however, the rising and falling figurations in the final seventeen bars resemble the crashing wave-like patterns at the end of <em>Tristan</em> (Exx. 3.9 and 3.10a–b). The final harmonic progression of <em>Caedmar</em> is also Wagnerian, echoing the plagal cadence of the so-called <em>Erlösungmotiv</em> found at the endings of the <em>Faust</em> Overture, <em>Der fliegende Holländer</em>, <em>Tristan</em>, and <em>Die Götterdämmerung</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref127" href='#_ftn127'>[127]</a> In Wagner this progression generally unfolds as IV-iv-I alongside the melodic motion <span class="comment">1, 2, 3 scale degrees</span>, and in <em>Holländer</em> and <em>Faust</em> the subdominant chords appear in second inversion. In Bantock’s version the subdominant harmony appears only in major form, but the effect is similar. In fact, the same progression, but including the minor subdominant, appears earlier during the instrumental introduction (in C major) and just after the climax of the love duet (in D major). The latter thus suggests a correspondence between Caedmar and Hulda’s union in love on earth and the meeting of their ‘souls’ in heaven at the end. Bantock also presents the subdominant chords in second inversion, further suggesting the influence of the <em>Holländer</em> ending.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref128" href='#_ftn128'>[128]</a></p>

    <p>As with much else in <em>Caedmar</em>, Bantock’s adoption of this characteristic Wagnerian gesture suggests only a partial assimilation and understanding of Wagner’s work. Contemporary critics observed that beneath the mask of Wagnerian grandiosity there was merely a hollow shell whereas in Wagner there were deep and meaningful ideas. In a 1909 article, for instance, the music critic John F. Runciman (1866–1916) argued that too many of Bantock’s works were made up of ‘ambitious nothings – moments that are not solemn and mysterious but mock-solemn and empty’. <em>Caedmar</em>, Runciman thought, was just such a work: ‘It is “Tristan” with the […] sublimity left out’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref129" href='#_ftn129'>[129]</a> If Bantock’s attempt at writing a libretto with a redemptive ending merely serves the purpose of justifying a monumental musical peroration, then <em>Caedmar</em> was no different to many other <em>fin-de-siècle</em> operas. Barbara Eichner has observed that the transcendental, death-and-transfiguration endings of Wagner’s operas and those of Wagnerian and post-Wagnerian composers were ‘first and foremost an excuse to stage an aurally and visually powerful finale’; she suggests that the music was not necessarily just a ‘cloak’ for a redemptive or transcendental ending, but rather ‘a transcendental message is a pretext to achieve a musically stunning finale’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref130" href='#_ftn130'>[130]</a> This is true of Bantock’s <em>Caedmar</em> in which the climactic musical ending with its Wagnerian redemption motif does not function as the musical expression of a deeply-held worldview. The superficial extramusical content, though grasping at Wagnerian grandeur, is secondary to the need for an imposing Wagnerian musical ending.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref131" href='#_ftn131'>[131]</a></p>
    

    <p>      As Eichner observes, these sorts of transcendent conclusions offered audiences an escape from ‘political and social realities’; they could transport listeners to a ‘seemingly “higher” plane’, and provide a disenchanted world with some sort of meaning.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref132" href='#_ftn132'>[132]</a> In short, one might say that these endings contributed to the re-enchanting impulse of Wagnerian and post-Wagnerian opera. In the case of <em>Caedmar</em>, this impulse is apparent not just in the pseudo-transcendent ending, but also in the work’s presentation of nature as magical and divine. To understand this pantheistic current in <em>Caedmar</em> it is necessary to explore <em>Caedmar’s</em> links with Wagner’s <em>Siegfried</em>.</p>
    <p>Like Siegfried, Caedmar is depicted as a child of nature. There is no clue as to Caedmar’s origins; as a knight-errant he has no home but instead wanders through the land, the hills, and the forests. Further resemblances to Siegfried are first suggested by the horn call (Ex. 3.11) that immediately precedes Caedmar’s entrance at the start of the opera. Julian Johnson has noted that the horn in nineteenth-century music became a ‘symbol of man-in-nature’, and ‘a sign for the qualities associated with the forest landscape’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref133" href='#_ftn133'>[133]</a> Thus, while the specific figuration of the horn call is not particularly like that of Siegfried’s, the general association with <em>Siegfried</em> is evident, and the horn itself further emphasises Caedmar’s ‘natural’ status and the magical forest environment that surrounds him. </p>

    <p>The strongest parallels with <em>Siegfried</em> occur in a twenty-two-bar section at figures 7:3–9:4 (Ex. 3.12). Caedmar enters, tired from a long day of travelling ‘over lofty hills, in lowly dales’, and sits down by a fallen tree. He listens to the sounds of the forest and hears birdsong start up, depicted by a melody passed between the oboe, clarinet, and flute, recalling the same effect at the start of the ‘Waldweben’ (‘Forest Murmurs’) music in Scene II, Act II of <em>Siegfried</em>. In fact, the ‘Waldweben’ music is further invoked by the oscillating accompanimental string figures that echo Wagner’s method for depicting the rustling of the leaves and the mysterious whispers of the forest. Like Siegfried, Caedmar listens in awe to the birds: ‘Hark to the songsters! Sweetly they sing their evensong’. He then sings a paean to nature, an explicitly pantheistic statement of the divinity of the natural world: ‘O joyous rapture! Heavenly bliss! Nature, Goddess divine!’.</p>

    <p>The nature music found in these twenty-two bars (referred to hereafter as the ‘nature interlude’) might be understood in terms of Carl Dahlhaus’s discussion of ‘the sound-sheet, or <em>Klangfläche</em>’, whereby music is ‘outwardly static but inwardly in constant motion’. This principle, Dahlhaus suggests, lies behind ‘almost all the outstanding musical renditions of nature’, including Wagner’s ‘Waldweben’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref134" href='#_ftn134'>[134]</a> Such musical depictions of nature are ‘exempted both from the principle of teleological progression and from […] “thematic-motivic manipulation”’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref135" href='#_ftn135'>[135]</a> Bantock’s nature interlude can be viewed as a miniature example of a <em>Klangfläche</em>. There is certainly a sense that this interlude stands outside of the ‘teleological progression’ of the rest of the music, and it neither develops motifs heard already nor presents motifs that are later developed. These twenty-two bars are also musically detached from their immediate surroundings, and to some extent from the rest of opera, in a number of ways. First, the interlude is preceded by a rest and a fermata over the barline so that the <em>pianissimo</em> accompaniment figure emerges out of the silence. Second, the start of the interlude also brings a change of time signature and of texture: nowhere else in the opera, except for six bars shortly after fig. 13 (see below), do the oscillating string figures reappear in quite the same way. Third, the bar immediately after the interlude has the effect of bringing the music out of its dream-like state as the abrupt return (and development) of the ‘Caedmar’ motif, with its forward-driving motion, signals a resumption of normal (in the sense implied by Dahlhaus) musical flow. Finally, the interlude is tonally closed in D major.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref136" href='#_ftn136'>[136]</a> A sense of inward movement, meanwhile, is created by the semiquaver rhythms of the oscillating string figures and the lively melody and trills in the woodwinds that imitate birdsong.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref137" href='#_ftn137'>[137]</a></p>
    
    <p>Caedmar’s awe of the enchanted forest landscape is also depicted by the unfolding of registral space and dynamic change during these twenty-two bars. At the start of the interlude there is only a simple melody passed between the winds marked <em>piano</em>, mostly in a high register and accompanied by the oscillation between e′′ and f#′′ in the first violin. After four bars the accompaniment thickens and begins to descend by step into a lower registral space. Then, at fig. 8:5 the music leaps downwards in register again (to c in the bass) while simultaneously there is an accelerando and crescendo that lead to yet further extremes of register, both high and low, alongside a <em>forte</em> dynamic marking – all coinciding for the climactic four bars of the interlude: ‘O joyous rapture! Heavenly bliss!’. Following this, at fig. 9, there is a sudden shift back to <em>pianissimo</em> in the orchestra and the registral space contracts once more (particularly in the vocal part), as if Caedmar is so overwhelmed by nature that he can only now produce a whisper to speak the words ‘Nature, Goddess divine!’.</p>
    <p>Daniel Grimley has suggested that landscape and nature can be understood in music not only in terms of pictorial evocation, local colour, or imitation of environmental sounds, but also structurally, ‘as [a] particular means of organising musical time and space’. Such ‘spatial and temporal organisation’ can suggest landscape in music through ‘more abstract musical rules’, including ‘patterns of registral behaviour’ and ‘dynamic shape’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref138" href='#_ftn138'>[138]</a> It is just such a ‘structural representation of landscape’ that Bantock’s music provides in this twenty-two-bar nature interlude. As the registral space and dynamic level expand, Caedmar’s attention turns away from the birdsong as he looks and listens around him and takes in the vast expanse of the forest landscape, the faint red glow of the setting sun, and the infinite grandeur and timelessness of nature. Thus, Bantock’s depiction of the natural world offers not only a musical representation of natural sounds, but also ‘a representation of the sense of being within a particular time and space’ – in this case Caedmar’s sense of being surrounded by the enchanted forest and at twilight.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref139" href='#_ftn139'>[139]</a></p>
    <p>Following this nature interlude, Caedmar sings of his desire to sleep and ‘raises a silent prayer to Heaven’ during an orchestral interlude before wishing ‘Goodnight!’ to ‘all around’ and falling asleep. On the ‘night’ of ‘Goodnight’, the oscillating string figures from the earlier nature interlude return, now as a shimmering <em>pianissimo</em> in a high register. Over six bars (figs. 13:4–13:9; Ex. 3.13) these figures gradually lead the music towards A major (at a local level at least) by way of a contracting contrary motion in the outer parts and an unusual chord progression passing through A minor (over a B pedal), B major, G major, C#7, and B minor, embellished by numerous suspensions, before coming to rest in A major after figure 14. Two of these progressions in particular, those from B major to G major (in first inversion) and from G major to C#7 – a mediant and tritone shift respectively – suggest certain magical (and Wagnerian) associations. Mediant chord progressions and modulations were commonplace in nineteenth-century music, but Julian Johnson notes that ‘this device came to be employed as one of the means by which nature was depicted musically as the site of transcendence’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref140" href='#_ftn140'>[140]</a> Thus, the return of the musical figurations associated with Bantock’s forest murmurs, combined with a ‘magical’ chord progression, emphasises the enchantment of the forest and the natural environment as a whole.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref141" href='#_ftn141'>[141]</a></p>

    <p>The nature worship at the start of the opera anticipates in various ways two of the most important moments later in the work: the climax of the love duet and Hulda’s death and transfiguration. In turn, these connections retrospectively link the nature interlude with erotic love and with transcendence. Perhaps the most obvious link between the earlier part of the opera and those later sections is the ecstatic exclamations that are characteristic of all of these sections: compare Caedmar in the nature interlude – ‘O joyous rapture! Heavenly bliss!’ – with the lovers’ in the duet – ‘What endless joy! O happiness supreme!’ – and with Hulda upon seeing the white light of heaven – ‘&#39;Tis growing larger! O so bright! An angel clothed in shining white! She beckons me. I come! I come! Farewell my love! I wait for thee above!’.</p>
    <p>The key in each of these three places in the score is D major. In fact, these three moments are the only parts of the opera where D major is established and accompanied by a two-sharp key signature.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref142" href='#_ftn142'>[142]</a> The connections between these three parts of <em>Caedmar</em> imply that there is some inextricable link between nature, sexual ecstasy and love, and death and transcendence. In <em>Tristan</em>, too, the lovers’ tryst in the realm of night is closely linked to the drama’s transcendent conclusion, where nature – the sea – functions as a backdrop to the whole scene, and Isolde’s ‘Liebestod’ is drenched in sea imagery. The awe Caedmar expresses at the birdsong and at being immersed in the magic of the forest landscape, therefore, is the same emotion as that experienced by the two lovers’ in their erotic union and the same as that Hulda experiences when she gazes into the ‘endless pure delight’ of heaven. In <em>Caedmar</em> nature is not merely a place where transcendence can happen; the divine is inherent within nature itself.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref143" href='#_ftn143'>[143]</a></p>
    <p>The appearance of the supernatural elves in <em>Caedmar</em>, in a rather incongruous set-piece intermezzo,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref144" href='#_ftn144'>[144]</a> further emphasises that the natural world is alive and enchanted. The elves might also be seen in the context of the so-called Celtic Twilight movement, many of the leading figures of which, including W. B. Yeats, had a strong interest in mythological creatures such as fairies, elves, gnomes, nymphs and the like. In this respect Bantock’s opera sets a precedent for later works by British composers inspired by Celtic themes, such as MacCunn’s <em>Diarmid</em> and numerous tone poems by Bax, which also featured or were inspired by mythological creatures which add to the enchantment of the Celtic landscapes and seascapes of which they are a part.</p>
    <p>The representation of nature in <em>Caedmar</em> might also be viewed in light of Bantock’s later work <em>The Great God Pan</em>, a ‘choral ballet’ in two parts (1914, incomplete).&#8288;<a id="_ftnref145" href='#_ftn145'>[145]</a> Bantock’s friend H. Orsmond Anderton provided a lengthy description of the work – conceived of as a colossal, all-singing, all-dancing extravaganza for the stage – in his biography of the composer. Anderton writes that Bantock evokes Pan ‘for an expression of the neo-paganism with which he identifies himself, both in its Arcadian aspects (Part I), and in its larger views of life (Part II)’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref146" href='#_ftn146'>[146]</a> As the choral prelude, ‘Invocation to Pan’, demonstrates, Bantock’s Pan is a Dionysian character: ‘God of liberty!’, ‘Spirit of music!’, ‘Soul of ecstasy!’, ‘Priest of delight’. But he is also ‘God of the forests!’, and as with <em>Caedmar</em> the first part of the work is set in a ‘woodland glade’ where Pan is accompanied by a chorus of ‘nymphs, dryads, fauns, satyrs, maenads, earth-spirits, and hunters’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref147" href='#_ftn147'>[147]</a> Matthew Riley has written that the ‘abundant and diverse’ references to Pan in English Victorian literature were part of a nostalgic attempt to reconnect alienated, modern humanity with nature, to ‘re-enchant’ the world and endow nature with personal significance, so that it seems to ‘speak’ once again.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref148" href='#_ftn148'>[148]</a> While it would be anachronistic to project Bantock’s ‘neo-pagan’ outlook expressed in <em>The Great God Pan</em> back onto <em>Caedmar</em>, the origins of this sort of world-view – a more explicit nature worship – are to be found in embryonic form in <em>Caedmar</em>, which itself is indebted in its most pantheistic scene to Wagner’s <em>Siegfried</em>.</p>
    <p>      The question of how <em>Caedmar</em>’s nature music fits into an English context also raises the issue of pastoralism, a lens through which the relationship between nature and English music has often been examined in recent years.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref149" href='#_ftn149'>[149]</a> Aidan Thomson, however, has recently linked English traditions of pastoralism to a kind of ruralism that was located principally in a picturesque ‘Anglo-Saxon “south country”’ where ‘an urban citizen’s experience of the countryside was generally recreational rather than occupational, s/he was, to some extent, in <em>control</em> of nature’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref150" href='#_ftn150'>[150]</a> This experience of ‘control’ suggests a modern relationship with nature as found in a disenchanted world where nature is tamed, and thus it is certainly not the sort of nature depicted in <em>Caedmar</em>. Moreover, the nature interlude of <em>Caedmar</em> does not contain many of the usual signifiers of pastoral music, and there is no trace of folksong influence in the opera at all. </p>
    <p>Thomson posits as a ‘sublime antipode’ to this English pastoralist relationship with nature an idea of the ‘Celtic North’. The landscapes and seascapes of this ‘Celtic North’, Thomson argues, inspired many of Arnold Bax’s later works and ‘suggest not so much human control over nature as the pantheistic submission to its extremes’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref151" href='#_ftn151'>[151]</a> This ‘romantic, dystopian, and sublime’ conception of nature is, of course, also a re-enchanted natural world.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref152" href='#_ftn152'>[152]</a> Taking into account <em>Caedmar</em>’s setting in Orkney in ancient Britain, it might seem likely that the nature interlude in <em>Caedmar</em> could be subsumed under the concept of the ‘Celtic North’. But while the protagonist’s experience of nature may be a sublime one, it is not ‘dystopian’ or threatening (though perhaps overwhelming), and thus not like the ‘Celtic North’ described by Thomson which offers no ‘solace’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref153" href='#_ftn153'>[153]</a> <em>Caedmar</em> displays only hints of the Celtic North aesthetic that was more fully realised in his own later works,&#8288;<a id="_ftnref154" href='#_ftn154'>[154]</a> as well as those of Holbrooke and Bax. In these later works, crucially, not just forests but Celtic seas are prominent and the composers were responding to and inspired by the environment of a particular place that they knew well, rather than depicting, as in <em>Caedmar</em>, a more universal ideal of nature located in a romanticised, mythical past.</p>
    
    <h2>3.6 Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">While re-enchanted representations of nature were not unique to Wagner’s music dramas in the long nineteenth century, the musical and dramatic parallels between <em>Caedmar</em> and the forest music of <em>Siegfried</em> demonstrate that it was Wagner to whom Bantock turned to find a model for expressing such an enchanted representation of nature in music. Nature, like the mysticism of <em>Lohengrin</em> and <em>Parsifal</em>, the magic potion in <em>Tristan</em>, the ghost-ship in <em>Holländer</em>, and the floating spear in <em>Parsifal</em>, was yet another thing that the master had made magic, and composers seeking to re-enchant the world happily embraced this view of nature and the Wagnerian means of portraying it in their pursuit of this goal.</p>
    <p>Parry’s <em>Guenever</em> may have proved a false dawn for British musical Wagnerism, and the <em>Meistersinger</em>-inspired strand of Elgar’s Wagnerism was never taken up by the younger generation of British Wagnerites, but the premieres of Bantock’s <em>Caedmar</em> and Wallace’s <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em> in 1892 marked the birth of two kinds of Wagnerism that would have a more enduring impact on British music. Not only would the mystical, proto-decadent strand shape what would become the most widely lauded monument of British musical Wagnerism, Elgar’s <em>Gerontius</em>, but the Celtic pantheistic strand emerged as a prominent force in the music of Holbrooke and Bax. Bantock was also partly responsible for the Wagnerian ventures of the subject of the next chapter, for when he was approached by a young librettist in 1906 to set to music a national drama based on Arthurian legends, he passed on the opportunity to Rutland Boughton. As a result, Boughton would go on to pursue the most ambitious of all British Wagnerian projects.∎</p>

      <p><a id="_ftn9" href='#_ftnref9'>[9]</a> Pantheism can be considered inherently ‘mystical’ because it is linked to the notion ‘of the overlap of God and nature, the intuition that in grasping the reality before us we grasp God himself, not something separate or intermediary’. In pantheistic terms, then, an encounter with nature is also an encounter with God, or with the absolute, an awareness of the oneness of all things, and thus a mystical experience.

Wallace evidently continued to adhere to this aesthetic as late as 1900: in his programme notes for his orchestral suite <em>Pélléas and Mélisande</em>, he described his ‘interpretation of the theme’ of Maeterlinck’s play ‘an attempt to conjure up an “atmosphere of emotion” by means of music’. Similarly, in his programme for his symphony <em>The Creation</em> he writes that ‘the music aims at depicting the emotion which the contemplation of the theme in its poetic and symbolical meaning is able to awaken’.

      <p><a id="_ftn43" href='#_ftnref43'>[43]</a> H. Orsmond Anderton, also wrote about the importance of the ‘Idea’ in two articles published in that journal: ‘Form in Art’, <em>New Quarterly Musical Review</em>, 1 (Nov. 1893), 138–52; and ‘The Next Phase of Musical Thought’, <em>New Quarterly Musical Review</em>, 2 (Feb. 1895), 181–8. </p>

Perhaps to avoid being associated explicitly with the partisan views expressed in the essay, Bantock signed the article ‘G. Ransome’ (G[ranville] Ransome [Bantock]). There does not appear to have been any other G. Ransome writing about music at the time, and various aspects of the article point to Bantock being the author. In particular, the composers who are cast in a positive light – Berlioz, Wagner, Liszt, Rubinstein – are those whose works Bantock programmed regularly during his time as musical director at the New Brighton Tower (1897–1900). Rubinstein’s ‘Ocean’ Symphony, which is praised in the article, was performed twice at New Brighton. See Paul Watt, ‘A “Gigantic and Popular Place of Entertainment”: Granville Bantock and Music-Making at the New Brighton Tower in the Late 1890s’, <em>Royal Musical Association Research Chronicle</em>, 42 (2009), 109–64. In addition, the remark near the start of the article that ‘musical art advanced westward from the East, where it derived its birth’, recalls the opening lines of another article by Bantock – ‘Confucianism and Music’ – that appeared in the same issue of the <em>New Quarterly Musical Review</em> (this one signed ‘Granville Bantock’): ‘Music had reached a high state of excellence in the Eastern world long before it had made its appearance in the West’. Granville Bantock, ‘Confucianism and Music’, 3 (Feb. 1896), 157–64. Shortly after the publication of ‘The Idea in Music’ the <em>Musical Standard</em> published a lengthy critique of the essay at the front of its 22 February issue, unsigned but probably by the journal’s editor, Edward Algernon Baughan. See ‘Absolute and Programme Music’, <em>Musical Standard</em>, 5 (Feb. 1896), 113–15.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn45" href='#_ftnref45'>[45]</a> [Bantock], ‘The Idea in Music’, 185. Bantock made similar remarks about programme music in a letter to the editor of the <em>Musical News</em> in May 1900, noting that ‘the growing tendency of the age […] seeks the expression of more concrete ideas […]. After all is said and done, music remains the ideal expression of the emotions’. Granville Bantock, ‘Programme Music: To the Editor of “Musical News”’, <em>Musical News</em>, 18 (May 1900), 502; also quoted in Michael Allis, ‘Bantock and Southey: Musical Otherness and Fatalism in <em>Thalaba the Destroyer</em>’, <em>Music &amp; Letters</em>, 95 (2014), 39–69 at 43. By the end of the nineteenth century such ideas were common currency among post-Wagnerian composers across Europe. Richard Strauss, for instance, wrote to Hans von Bülow in 1888 that to ‘create a work of art’ which will ‘give the listener a clear and definite impression’, the composer must seek ‘inspiration by a poetical idea, whether or not it be introduced as a program’.

      <p><a id="_ftn49" href='#_ftnref49'>[49]</a> In an 1855 essay on Berlioz’s ‘Harold’ Symphony, for instance, he stated that ‘In program music, the recurrence, variation, alteration, and modulation of motifs are determined by their relationship to a poetic idea’.

      <p><a id="_ftn59" href='#_ftnref59'>[59]</a> <em>La Vita Nuova</em> concerns the author’s life from age nine to twenty-five, detailing his love for and his mourning over the death of Beatrice Portinari, the inspiration for the Beatrice who acts as Dante’s guide in the <em>Paradiso</em>.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn60" href='#_ftnref60'>[60]</a> Liszt had initially planned to compose a third movement – the <em>Paradiso</em> – but was discouraged by Wagner who argued that it would be impossible to depict Paradise in music. See Kenneth Hamilton, ‘Wagner and Liszt: Elective Affinities’, in Grey (ed.), <em>Richard Wagner and his World</em> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2009), 27–64 at 56. A number of other British composers also wrote music inspired by Dante: Bantock composed a tone poem entitled <em>Dante and Beatrice</em> (1901; rev. 1910), while Rutland Boughton arranged some music and composed one song of his own for a <em>Dante and Beatrice</em> play by Emily Underdown (1903). Edgar Bainton composed, but did not complete, a large-scale choral work entitled <em>The Transfiguration of Dante</em> (1908). An opera, again with the title <em>Dante and Beatrice</em>, by a composer named Stephen Rowland Philpot was produced in London in 1889. On the Continent, too, Dante inspired works such as Benjamin Godard’s opera <em>Dante</em> (1889) and Tchaikovsky’s symphonic poem <em>Francesca da Rimini</em> (1876). See also Maria Ann Roglieri, ‘From “le rime aspre e chiocce to la dolce sinfonia di Paradiso”: Musical Settings of Dante’s “Commedia”, <em>Dante Studies</em>, 113 (1995), 175–208.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn61" href='#_ftnref61'>[61]</a> Dante, dazzled by the light of Paradise, turns round expecting to see Beatrice but instead sees an old man, his final guide St. Bernard, who tells Dante that Beatrice has taken her place in the rose.

Rossetti’s lifelong interest in his namesake, Dante Alighieri, is evidenced by his paintings, prose, translation work and even his first name. Rossetti’s father was a Dante scholar, and his family as a whole was ‘steeped in Dante’.

In fact, as Barringer points out, there was no ‘single coherent religious position’ among the Pre-Raphaelites.

      <p><a id="_ftn83" href='#_ftnref83'>[83]</a> Hanson, <em>Decadence and Catholicism</em>, 5. Max Nordau regarded the Pre-Raphaelites as an important link in the chain of a Catholic-tinged tradition of decadence. He dedicated a chapter to the Pre-Raphaelites in his famous attack on decadent art, arguing that while ‘the religious enthusiasm of degenerate and hysterical Englishmen’ first manifested itself in the Oxford Movement in the 1830s and 40s, ‘in the world of art’ this degenerate mysticism first ‘sought its expression in pre-Raphaelitism’.

      <p><a id="_ftn84" href='#_ftnref84'>[84]</a> Many of his friends were artists or sculptors and Wallace himself painted and designed sheet music covers. Carson, ‘“A Protean Spirit”: William Wallace: Artist, Composer and Catalyst’, 16–17.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn85" href='#_ftnref85'>[85]</a> The literary critic Mario Praz suggested that the decadent Swinburne’s ‘tainted beauty’ and representations of women were ‘undoubtedly influenced not a little by the example of the Pre-Raphaelites’. He points specifically to the ‘cruel, fatal woman’ in <em>Sister Helen</em> as an example. Mario Praz, <em>The Romantic Agony</em> (London: Oxford University Press, 1933), 218. Stephen Downes observes that the <em>femme fatale</em> was a ‘typical obsession of the decadent or symbolist’.

This remark also echoes Nietzsche’s comment that ‘the genuinely free artist […] cannot help but think simultaneously in all arts’.

Ulrike Kienzle, ‘<em>Parsifal</em> and Religion: A Christian Music Drama’, in William Kinderman and Katherine R. Syer (eds.), <em>A Companion to Wagner’s Parsifal</em> (Woodbridge: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2005), 81–130 at 103, 124.

The difference between the mysticism of the prelude to <em>Lohengrin</em> and that of <em>Parsifal</em> is summed by what Bernard McGinn refers to as the ‘two broad camps’ that ‘conceptions of [mystical] union fall into’: ‘(1) union conceived of as a uniting of the Infinite Spirit with the finite spirit in a bond of love that emphasizes the distinction between creator and creature [Lohengrin], and (2) union of indistinction that claims that, on some level, God and human are merged into what Meister Eckhart called ein einic ein (“a single/simple One”) [Parsifal]’.

      <p><a id="_ftn113" href='#_ftnref113'>[113]</a> Marc Brooks has recently identified a ‘timeless, eternal quality’ in the opening music of <em>Parsifal</em>, where he observes the effect of so-called ‘oceanic time’, a blissful experience which may occur through the ‘intoxication of love’ or ‘ecstatic states of mystic experience’. Musically, this effect is created in the <em>Parsifal</em> prelude through ‘the syncopations that leave [the opening melody] suspended across the regularity of the meter, the shimmering background, […] the unusual chord progression’, and, in bars 9–10, the ‘separate divisions of the beat in winds and strings that conflict with each other in multiple ways’.

      <p><a id="_ftn114" href='#_ftnref114'>[114]</a> Two reviews of the premiere of Beatrice mentioned that the cadence of this chorale theme was derived from Arcadelt – information the critics appear to have gleaned from the original programme notes, which I have not been able to trace. See ‘Concerts of the Week’, <em>The Graphic</em>, 3 Dec. 1892, 671; and ‘Music and the Drama’, <em>Glasgow Herald</em>, 28 Nov. 1892, 4.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn115" href='#_ftnref115'>[115]</a> Wallace might also have known that Arcadelt had lived in Florence for a time. Wallace’s work can be interpreted in relation to Rossetti’s Pre-Raphaelite painting in other ways, too. For example, the two parallel nine-bar phrases with which <em>Beatrice</em> begins (each split into 5+4 bars) could be a reference to Rossetti’s sundial cast at nine, which itself stems from Dante’s description of the time of Beatrice’s death. This might seem like an outlandish suggestion if were not for the fact that Wallace displayed a strong interest in numerology in some of his other works. See John Purser’s discussion of numerology in Wallace’s <em>Creation</em> Symphony in John Purser, liner notes for BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Martyn Brabbins, <em>William Wallace: Creation Symphony, Pelléas and Mélisande, Prelude to the Eumenides</em>, CDA66987 (UK: Hyperion, 1997), 9–11.</p>

However, he might have imagined that during the period in which the opera is set – in ‘ancient Britain’ – there were still forests in Orkney. The use of the word ‘Inistore’ to describe the islands perhaps indicates the influence of James Macpherson’s <em>Ossian</em> cycle in which ‘Inistore’ is often used in place of ‘Orkney’.</p>

      <p><a id="_ftn125" href='#_ftnref125'>[125]</a> <em>The Graphic</em>’s critic wrote that Andred’s ‘make-up is curiously like that of the Nibelung Alberich in Wagner’s opera’. ‘The Opera Season: Mr. Bantock’s Opera, “Caedmar”’, <em>The Graphic</em>, 29 Oct. 1892, 17.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn126" href='#_ftnref126'>[126]</a> Bantock’s description of the vision certainly recalls that found at the end of <em>Holländer</em>: ‘In the glow of the rising sun, the transfigured forms of the Dutchman and Senta, clasped in each other’s arms, are seen rising over the wreck and soaring into the sky’.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn127" href='#_ftnref127'>[127]</a> Barbara Eichner notes that since Wagner had used this harmonic progression ‘from his <em>Faust</em> Overture onwards it had become a standard formulation in nineteenth-century music’. In fact, it can be found as a framing gesture in Chopin’s Nocturne in Ab major, Op. 32, No. 2, which was published in 1837, two years before Wagner first begun work on his <em>Faust</em> Overture. Nonetheless, in the explicitly Wagnerian context of <em>Caedmar</em> it seems clear that Bantock was conscious of his reference to Wagner.

      <p><a id="_ftn128" href='#_ftnref128'>[128]</a> Previewing the opera the day before its first performance, the <em>Manchester Guardian</em>’s critic wrote that the work concluded with an ‘apotheosis, somewhat after the fashion of “Faust” and the “Fliegende Holländer”’. ‘Music and the Drama’, <em>Manchester Guardian</em>, 17 Oct. 1892, 6.</p>

Similarly, another critic wrote in 1892 that the ending of <em>Caedmar</em> ‘struck some of the audience as a crossing of the narrow borderland which separates the sublime from the ridiculous’. ‘The Triple Bill at the New Olympic Theatre’, <em>Bury and Norwich Post</em>, 8 Nov. 1892, 7.</p>

      <p><a id="_ftn131" href='#_ftnref131'>[131]</a> Eichner writes that ‘the “fiction” of transcendence proved just as powerful as the “real thing” because it gave an opportunity to bring out all the strengths of the late-Romantic musical language’. Ibid. 121.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn132" href='#_ftnref132'>[132]</a> Ibid. 122. When Bantock wrote in 1890 that the audience of the music drama of the future ‘would exist in the presence of an ideal world’, uninterrupted by distractions during the performance, he appears to have had this kind of enchanted escapism in mind.</p>

Johnson also writes that horn was often used ‘to evoke physical distance […] sounds heard moving through the physical space of a real landscape’. Significantly, then, the horn call in <em>Caedmar</em> first appears ‘in the distance’ and then as an ‘echo’, depicting the spatial expanse of the forest landscape.</p>

      <p><a id="_ftn135" href='#_ftnref135'>[135]</a> Ibid. Elsewhere Dahlhaus writes that ‘the Forest Murmurs, the song of the Woodbird, and Siegfried’s horn call, in a sense block the musical passage of time and are at odds with the progress of cadential harmony towards a goal. They express a state of nature, outside history’. Dahlhaus, <em>Richard Wagner’s Music Dramas</em>, 127. See also Johnson, <em>Webern and the Transformation of Nature</em>, 232.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn136" href='#_ftnref136'>[136]</a> Although the vocal score correctly shows that there is an A in the bass on the downbeat of the last bar of the interlude, lasting for two quaver beats, it does not make it clear (as the full score does) that there is a D in the middle of the bass clef sustained throughout the bar by one of the bassoon parts. Thus, the last two thirds of the bar and its D major triad are actually supported by the tonic in the bass, meaning that is a clear V-I motion in D major at the end.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn137" href='#_ftnref137'>[137]</a> A sense of internal motion may be engendered, Dahlhaus suggests, by certain ‘rhythmic patterns’ or through the dissonance of an ‘unresolved nonharmonic tone’ that ‘stands outside the harmonic logic’ of the normal flow of music. Dahlhaus, <em>Nineteenth-Century Music</em>, 307–8.</p>

      <p><a id="_ftn141" href='#_ftnref141'>[141]</a> The contracting motion and the mediant and tritone shifts also bring to mind the ‘magic sleep’ motif and subsequent music found at the end of Wagner’s <em>Die Walküre</em>, a parallel further reinforced by the fact that this point in <em>Caedmar</em> depicts the hero falling asleep. The idea of an enchanted sleep, connected with notions of dreams and dreaming, and the mysterious realm of night, yet further heightens the magic of this point in the drama.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn142" href='#_ftnref142'>[142]</a> I am excluding here the central section of the Elves’ dance (the intermezzo), as this is essentially an inserted piece that is extraneous to the rest of the opera. The only other two other places in the score where D major is properly established by cadences – but only briefly and without the accompanying key signature – further reinforce the associations with love and heaven: at fig. 62:7–8 an IAC in D major occurs exactly at the words ‘with a heavenly joy’; and around fig. 49 D major is established as Hulda ‘turns gratefully towards [Caedmar] and gazes silently into his face’.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn143" href='#_ftnref143'>[143]</a> Musical depictions of nature as magical, enchanted, divine, demonic, or sublime were not, of course, limited to Wagner and Wagnerians but found in the works of composers from all over Europe. Julian Johnson states that ‘music was often elided with a re-enchanted landscape’ in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century music. Julian Johnson, <em>Out of Time:</em> <em>Music and the Making of Modernity</em> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), 192. Johnson argues that, compared with painting, for instance, music was particularly well suited to re-enchant nature: ‘where landscape painting confirms the external world through the rational sense of vision, musical landscapes plunge the listener into the far more irrational world of hearing’. See also David Huckvale, <em>Visconti and the German Dream: Romanticism, Wagner and the Nazi Catastrophe in Film</em> (Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland &amp; Co., 2012), 62.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn144" href='#_ftnref144'>[144]</a> In the vocal score the elves appear ‘from the bushes’ just after Caedmar falls asleep and ‘noiselessly gambol around in the [moon]light’. At both the Crystal Palace and Olympic Theatre performances of <em>Caedmar</em> this intermezzo was heard not at this early point in the opera but instead in the middle of the lovers’ duet. The manuscript orchestral score marks the point where it was inserted: just after Caedmar sings ‘&#39;Tis surely an enchanting dream’ (before fig. 73). Bantock stuck to the manuscript score here an alternative transitional passage for the cello that would lead to the A major tonality of the dance, and, similarly added a rather unconvincing transition at the end of the dance that would lead back to the Eb major at fig. 73. Cadbury Research Library, University of Birmingham, GB/3/1/1. It is unclear why Bantock chose to change the position of the intermezzo for the performance, particularly as it makes much less sense – both musically and dramatically – for it to appear in the middle of the duet. Some contemporary critics (most of whom were baffled by the repositioning of the intermezzo) speculated that it was an attempt to relieve the length of the duet. See, for instance, ‘Signor Lago’s Royal Opera’, <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em>, 26 Oct. 1892, 2; and ‘Our London Correspondence’, <em>Glasgow Herald</em>, 19 Oct. 1892, 7.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn145" href='#_ftnref145'>[145]</a> The first part, ‘Pan in Arcady’, was completed in 1914, but the second part, ‘The Festival of Pan’, was never finished, though parts of it found their way into Bantock’s <em>Pagan</em> Symphony. These two parts are preceded by a choral prelude entitled ‘Invocation to Pan’. For further discussion of the influence of the various legends relating to Pan and Bantock’s interest in them (especially in relation to <em>The Great God Pan</em>), see Matthew Louis Kickasola, ‘Granville Bantock and the English Choral Imagination’ (Ph.D. diss., Washington University, 2009), 191–215.</p>

As Riley, and also Johnson and Grimley point out, nostalgia often intersected with enchantment, nature, and music. But the role of nostalgia, if it has one, is not straightforward in <em>Caedmar</em>. As with Siegfried, Caedmar experiences nature in his own enchanted present, not through a sense of nostalgia. But for the audience it is a mythical past, in this case ancient (Celtic) Britain, and this pre-modern setting could signify a desire to reinvigorate the present with a dash of magic from an imagined, idealised past – a nostalgic yearning of sorts.
