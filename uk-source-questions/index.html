    <div id="Guenever" class="tab-detail city">
      <h2><em>Guenever</em></h2>
      <p class="first-para-section">Act I</p>
      <p class="first-para-section"><em>Outside Chester walls. Trumpet calls in the town. Early morning. ? (I’m not sure sunset wouldn’t be more to the point). Crowd of town and country people gathering and dancing</em>.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref1" href='#_ftn1'>[1]</a></p>
      <p class="first-para-section">Following an opening chorus, executioners enter and pile wood to prepare for the burning of Guenever at the stake. The crowd begins to disperse and Gareth enters, bringing news that Lancelot approaches and intends to slay all those ‘that ill of his Lady’s love hath spoken’. Mordred arrives and dismisses Gareth’s pleas for ‘one more day of grace’. A bewildered Guenever is led out to the stake and is condemned by Mordred and a bloodthirsty crowd. Guenever makes an impassioned defence of her innocence, and consequently Gareth tries to help her but is immobilized by Mordred’s men. At the moment the fire is lit, Lancelot and his knights arrive at speed, knocking the crowd aside. In the ensuing chaos Lancelot, ‘coming rapidly behind Gareth &amp; mistaking him for one of the executioners strikes him down’. Lancelot puts out the fire and helps Guenever down.</p>
      <p class="first-para-section">Act II</p>
      <p class="first-para-section"><em>A large hall with large doorway with curtains in the centre, &amp; small door on one side &amp; a window on the opposite side. A dais with throne. Ladies gathered near the window embroidering</em>.</p>
      <p class="first-para-section">A chorus of ladies recounts the tragic love of Tristram, Isoud [<em>sic</em>] and King Mark, before a group of ‘Knights enter bearing the body of Gareth’. Lyones, Gareth’s wife, enters the hall and throws herself on his body. She curses whoever slew Gareth, and is soon told by Mordred that it was Lancelot. Arthur enters and Mordred informs him of the events at the stake. Lancelot arrives with his knights, eventually followed by Guenever, and the two lovers plead for Arthur’s forgiveness. The knights who are present swear not to doubt Guenever again, and Arthur forgives her while proclaiming that he and Lancelot must be enemies until death. After Lancelot and Guenever bid their farewells, a chorus of Arthurs’ knights prepare for war (‘Bear forth the banner’). Arthur recalls a dream he had the previous night in which he was met by Gareth and a ‘mystic throng’ in Avalon. Arthur kisses Guenever farewell and leaves for battle. Mordred enters and seeks Guenever’s pardon, which she does not grant him, and then he reveals to the Queen his treacherous plans to usurp Arthur. A group of knights swear allegiance to Mordred and to Arthur’s death.</p>
      <p class="first-para-section">Act III</p>
      <p class="first-para-section"><em>On the borders of a lake. A small chapel to one side. Darkness. [Translated from Althaus’s German:] After a prelude Lyones appears and turns to the chapel, where she kneels in a dark room by a discernible image of the Mother of God</em>.</p>
      <p class="first-para-section">After a lament by Lyones, in which she repeats her wish for Lancelot’s downfall, Mordred enters stating that he has slain Arthur in battle but has yet to find his body among the dead. Arthur, not dead after all, arrives angrily and a fight breaks out between Arthur, Mordred and their respective knights, culminating with Mordred’s death. Lyones emerges from the shadows and vows to kill Guenever. Arthur asks Lyones to forget her wrath and to take to Guenever a ring and a message: ‘Arthur calleth. He weds thee with this ring anew and at god’s high throne he bids thee meet him’. Lyones agrees and exits. Arthur asks a few of his knights to take his sword and throw it into the water. While they do this, Arthur has a vision of a future regenerated Britain. The knights return and inform Arthur that an arm rose from the water and grabbed the sword. Arthur asks them to carry him to the shore, where a barge of queens approaches to take Arthur to Avalon. Arthur is placed in the barge and the act ends with the knights lamenting Arthur’s passing, along with a chorus of queens.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref2" href='#_ftn2'>[2]</a></p>
      <p class="first-para-section">Act IV</p>
      <p class="first-para-section"><em>The court of a nunnery. In the centre the door of a large church with steps up to it. At the side a door to enter the precincts from without</em>.</p>
      <p class="first-para-section">Guenever laments that she will not see Lancelot again, and she asks God to bring her death. Lancelot arrives at the nunnery, suggesting that now Arthur is dead, he (Lancelot) and Guenever should resume their relations. Guenever is reluctant at first but soon gives Lancelot her hand. A love duet ensues, and after some seduction from Lancelot the pair kiss. Lyones suddenly appears bearing Arthur’s ring and message, along with a warning that the lovers’ joy will be short-lived. After Lyones’s exit Lancelot bolts the doors to the court shut to keep out a group of knights who call for ‘Death to the traitor’ and eventually break their way in. While Lancelot is fending off the knights, a group of women also burst in exclaiming ‘Slay the adulteress’. Lyones sneaks past Lancelot and stabs Guenever. The fighting ceases and Guenever sings one last time to welcome death and to pray that she may be forgiven and her soul ascend to heaven. The opera ends with a chorus of nuns praying for Guenever’s forgiveness as ‘They bear her on a shield in procession into the church’.&#8288;<a id="_ftnref3" href='#_ftn3'>[3]</a></p>
