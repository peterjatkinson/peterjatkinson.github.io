    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p class="first-para-section dropcap">In his 1999 study of Wagnerism in French opera at the <em>fin de siècle</em>, Steven Huebner observed that a ‘curious situation’ had arisen in scholarship whereby ‘Wagnerian influence [had] been considered much more in relation to French letters […] than in relation to [Richard] Wagner’s own art of music’.<a id="_ftnref1" href='#_ftn1'>[1]</a> Huebner’s book sought to redress this imbalance, and in recent years a number of studies have considered the impact of Wagnerism on the music and composers of various other countries and regions.<a id="_ftnref2" href='#_ftn2'>[2]</a> Nearly two decades after the publication of Huebner’s book, however, a comparable situation to that which he identified in 1999 still persists in the study of British Wagnerism. This state of affairs is in part a result of an understanding of Wagnerism (defined in the most basic sense as ‘relating to the political and aesthetic ideas or the musical works of Wagner’) that has marginalised the role that music played in the phenomenon.<a id="_ftnref3" href='#_ftn3'>[3]</a> Scholars such as Erwin Koppen, for example, have described Wagnerism as ‘a predominantly, if not exclusively, <em>extramusical</em> form of Wagner reception’, suggesting that Wagner’s influence was far greater on literature, visual art and philosophical ideas than it was on music.<a id="_ftnref4" href='#_ftn4'>[4]</a> In a similar vein, Arnold Whittall has observed that ‘very little music of significance that recalls Wagner’s own style closely and sustainedly has survived’.<a id="_ftnref5" href='#_ftn5'>[5]</a> That Koppen subsequently adds to his assertion the caveat that this is ‘especially true of France, [but] less so of Germany, England, and Italy’,<a id="_ftnref6" href='#_ftn6'>[6]</a> reveals one of the main reasons for his and others’ non-musical conceptions of Wagnerism: the emphasis on France and Paris as the ‘birthplace’ and capital of the phenomenon has meant that it has become associated in particular with the French Symbolist movement, its Wagnerian periodical, the <em>Revue wagnérienne</em> (1885–8), and figures such as Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé, Maurice Maeterlinck, Édouard Dujardin and Téodor de Wyzewa.<a id="_ftnref7" href='#_ftn7'>[7]</a></p>
    <p>Although a focus on Wagner’s influence on <em>fin-de-siècle</em> French literature has to some extent skewed the direction of the scholarly discourse on Wagnerism – shifting it away from music and composers – the two other criteria which Koppen uses to distinguish Wagnerism from a more general ‘Wagner worship’ apply equally to late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century music as they do to Symbolist poetry. The first of these criteria states that, in Wagnerism, Wagner’s art and ideas became intertwined with certain ‘currents’, ‘programs and ideologies’, which were ‘projected onto Wagner’. Koppen’s second criterion stipulates that Wagnerism was a phenomenon confined to a particular historical period which began in the 1860s and came to an end around the years of the First World War.<a id="_ftnref8" href='#_ftn8'>[8]</a> As indicated by the time period chosen as the focus of this thesis (1880–1920), British musical Wagnerism’s start and end dates more or less correspond with the suggested boundaries of Koppen’s Wagnerian epoch. Moreover, as the subsequent chapters of this thesis will demonstrate, British composers and their collaborators ‘projected’ all kinds of ‘programs and ideologies’ onto Wagner, and what unifies many of the case studies explored here is precisely the recurring intersection of Wagnerism with a number of cultural ‘currents’ or movements.</p>
    <p>The fact that there still exists no major study of British music and Wagnerism is also a result of issues in the historiography of British music. During the second half of the twentieth century, sweeping historical accounts of British music that covered the period 1880–1920 were predominantly concerned with the composers, compositional styles, ideologies and aesthetics associated with the so-called ‘English Musical Renaissance’.<a id="_ftnref9" href='#_ftn9'>[9]</a> Broadly speaking, studies of this ‘Renaissance’ have focussed on a notion of national music that was connected to a group of composers who worked and studied at the Royal College of Music (RCM) – including Hubert Parry (1848–1918), Charles Villiers Stanford (1852–1924), Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872–1958) and Gustav Holst (1874–1934) – and which has been linked (not always accurately) with pastoralism, folk- and Tudor-music influences, and Englishness (rather than a wider notion of Britishness). </p>
    <p>Such studies have tended to marginalise another group of composers, most of whom either studied at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) or were linked in some way with musical life in Birmingham (with the University of Birmingham and the Midlands Institute). Members of this group included Granville Bantock (1868–1946), William Wallace (1860–1940), Joseph Holbrooke (1878–1958), Rutland Boughton (1878–1960) and Arnold Bax (1883–1953). In their revisionist history of the Renaissance (the inaccuracies and problems of which have been highlighted by Alain Frogley),<a id="_ftnref10" href='#_ftn10'>[10]</a> Robert Stradling and Meirion Hughes portray Edward Elgar (1857–1934) as the figurehead of this group, and allude to these composers’ attempts to create an alternative ‘Midlands’ school of composition, united by Wagnerian-Lisztian-Straussian (and later Debussyan) aesthetics and their interests in Celticism.<a id="_ftnref11" href='#_ftn11'>[11]</a> Despite their ‘character assassination[s]’ of RCM composers,<a id="_ftnref12" href='#_ftn12'>[12]</a> however, Stradling and Hughes ultimately perpetuate the dominance of this group by making those composers the focus of their study, and concluding that the RAM-Midlands composers failed to provide a ‘serious alternative to RVW’s version of “national music”, either in terms of ideological policy or aesthetic programme’.<a id="_ftnref13" href='#_ftn13'>[13]</a> In characterising these composers as a peripheral and ultimately insignificant group, Stradling and Hughes also relegate Wagnerism to a marginal position in the history of British music. </p>
    <p>While the field of British music studies has expanded significantly in recent years, new approaches have not so far been conducive to encouraging studies of the Wagnerian composers mentioned above, with the exception of the already much-written-about Elgar. Attempts to understand twentieth-century British music through the lens of modernism, for example, have for the most part focussed on more canonical British composers such as Elgar, Vaughan Williams, Holst and, later, William Walton and Benjamin Britten.<a id="_ftnref14" href='#_ftn14'>[14]</a> The limited amount of literature dealing with British opera of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries has also contributed to the scholarly neglect of British music and Wagnerism. Only recently has Paul Rodmell’s study of opera in the British Isles offered a much-needed corrective to the misguided notion that Britain lacked a thriving operatic culture during this period.<a id="_ftnref15" href='#_ftn15'>[15]</a> But although British <em>music</em> and Wagnerism has not yet been examined comprehensively, British Wagnerism as a cultural movement more generally has been examined from various perspectives, and in order to fully understand its musical manifestations and to situate it in its proper context, it is first necessary to provide an overview of this work.</p>
    
    <h2>British Wagnerism</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">The most extensive study of British Wagnerism that has been published to date is Anne Dzamba Sessa’s 1979 book <em>Richard Wagner and The English</em>.<a id="_ftnref16" href='#_ftn16'>[16]</a> Sessa’s work focusses almost exclusively on Wagnerism in the nineteenth century, and she considers the phenomenon primarily in terms of the critical reception of and written discourse surrounding Wagner’s works and ideas. In the first part of her book, Sessa charts the development of British Wagner reception over the period of his three visits to England in 1839, 1855 and 1877. Sessa also documents the founding of the London Wagner Society in 1873, the establishment of its journal, <em>The Meister</em> (1888–95), and explores the role of some of the key critics and writers involved in either promoting or rejecting Wagnerism in nineteenth-century Britain, including James Davison, Joseph Bennett, Francis Hueffer, Edward Dannreuther and William Ashton Ellis.<a id="_ftnref17" href='#_ftn17'>[17]</a> The last three decades of the nineteenth century, the period during which British Wagnerism properly emerged (in the 1870s) and, in certain spheres, reached its apogee (in the 1890s), has formed the focus of a number of other historical studies of the Wagnerian phenomenon in Britain. Most notably, David Cormack has recently published a lengthy and well-researched essay on the life and work of Ashton Ellis, and there exist a number of studies of groups, organisations and other individuals who played an important role in the early years of British Wagnerism, including (in addition to Hueffer, Dannreuther and Ellis) Julius Cyriax, Hans Richter, David Irvine and, slightly later, Ernest Newman.<a id="_ftnref18" href='#_ftn18'>[18]</a></p>
    <p>The remainder of Sessa’s book, aside from sections on George Bernard Shaw’s socialist interpretation of Wagner’s <em>Ring</em> and David Irvine’s Schopenhauer-inspired writings on Wagner, is principally concerned with Wagner’s influence on English literature and his impact on late nineteenth-century religious and spiritual ideas. In the case of the latter, Sessa explores how Wagner’s dramas, especially <em>Parsifal</em>, were interpreted by British authors from a wide range of perspectives, including Christianity, Buddhism, humanism and, especially, Theosophy, the quasi-religious movement that combined ideas from Eastern philosophies and Western science, and whose relationship with British Wagnerism has been investigated again more recently by Christopher Scheer.<a id="_ftnref19" href='#_ftn19'>[19]</a> In her discussion of literature, Sessa focusses on the intersection of British Wagnerism with decadence and eroticism in the work of writers such as Algernon Charles Swinburne, Arthur Symons and Oscar Wilde. British literary Wagnerism has in fact been studied more extensively than any other aspect of Wagner’s influence on British culture,<a id="_ftnref20" href='#_ftn20'>[20]</a> and decadence has emerged as a key theme in much of this scholarship, as it has, to a lesser extent, in discussions of Wagnerism in the visual arts in Britain. The relationship between decadence and British Wagnerism has been treated most effectively by Emma Sutton in her book <em>Aubrey Beardsley and British Wagnerism in the 1890s</em>.<a id="_ftnref21" href='#_ftn21'>[21]</a> Sutton demonstrates how the drawings and writings of Beardsley, an artist who was ‘at the forefront of British artistic and literary Wagnerism’ at the <em>fin de siècle</em>,<a id="_ftnref22" href='#_ftn22'>[22]</a> exemplify the ways in which Wagner and Wagnerism in the 1890s came to be associated with, and reinterpreted through the lenses of, decadence, aestheticism and related ideas such as (homo)eroticism, sensuality, femininity, hysteria, debilitation, degeneration and disease.<a id="_ftnref23" href='#_ftn23'>[23]</a></p>
    <p>In sum, Sessa’s book covers three broad types of British Wagnerism that have been identified by David C. Large: ‘an “aesthetic” or decadent direction’, linked to French Wagnerism and exemplified by the work of artists such as Beardsley, Wilde, Swinburne and Symons; the Wagnerism of those who ‘found in Wagner a comprehensive value-system that might serve as an alternative to the Victorian belief in technological progress’, exemplified by Wagnerites such as Ashton Ellis (a Theosophist); and Wagnerism that was explicit in its social (often socialist) critique of modern (capitalist) society, associated primarily (and almost exclusively) with G. B. Shaw’s analysis of the <em>Ring</em> in his book <em>The Perfect Wagnerite</em>.<a id="_ftnref24" href='#_ftn24'>[24]</a></p>
    <p> Large’s categories of British Wagnerism are based entirely on critical and literary manifestations of Wagnerism, and make no reference to how and if these categories could be mapped onto the world of British music. One reason for the absence of British composers from accounts of British Wagnerism is that, with the notable exception of Hubert Parry, they had little association with the Wagner Society or the official mouthpiece of British <em>fin-de-siècle</em> Wagnerism, <em>The Meister</em>, the journal edited by William Ashton Ellis.<a id="_ftnref25" href='#_ftn25'>[25]</a> In the case of <em>The Meister</em>, this was largely a result of Ellis’s lack of interest in music <em>per se</em>. Ellis’s introduction to the first issue of <em>The Meister</em> made it clear that it was not a journal focussed on music or one primarily for musicians: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Had [Wagner] never composed one bar of music, and never conceived one scene of drama, his prose works alone would have ranked him amongst the foremost thinkers of the day.<a id="_ftnref26" href='#_ftn26'>[26]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>References to contemporary British composers in <em>The Meister</em> are almost non-existent, aside from a brief reference to Charles Villiers Stanford’s <em>Irish</em> Symphony,<a id="_ftnref27" href='#_ftn27'>[27]</a> a note of Hamish MacCunn’s (1868–1916) presence at a dinner hosted by the London Wagner Society to entertain Siegfried Wagner,<a id="_ftnref28" href='#_ftn28'>[28]</a> and a paragraph on Parry’s Fourth Symphony.<a id="_ftnref29" href='#_ftn29'>[29]</a></p>

    <h2>The Emergence of British Musical Wagnerism</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">It was not the case, however, that British composers did not contribute to the promotion of Wagner in Britain during the latter half of the nineteenth century. Frederick Corder, a composer and professor of composition and harmony at the RAM, began promoting Wagner in the press in the 1870s, continued into the 1880s and was one of the first in England to write in detail about Wagner from a musical perspective.<a id="_ftnref30" href='#_ftn30'>[30]</a> Despite being a committed Wagnerite, however, the style of Corder’s own music from this period was hardly Wagnerian at all, a fact that points to a wider issue that has contributed to the neglect of composers in accounts of British Wagnerism.<a id="_ftnref31" href='#_ftn31'>[31]</a> Although composers such as Parry, Stanford and Alexander Campbell Mackenzie (1847–1935) began to incorporate elements of Wagner’s compositional technique into their operas in the 1880s, it was not until the 1890s that British composers such as Bantock and Wallace began to embrace a Wagnerian musical language more wholeheartedly, and Wagnerian practices were still not really widespread until 1900.<a id="_ftnref32" href='#_ftn32'>[32]</a> There was, then, a certain time lag separating the critical acceptance of Wagner in Britain and the integration of Wagnerian compositional techniques into British music. Consequently, by the time many of the composers who studied under Corder at the RAM emerged from their training, the musical climate had already become distinctly ‘<em>post</em>-Wagnerian’.<a id="_ftnref33" href='#_ftn33'>[33]</a></p>

    <div class="box">
      <h2 class="box-heading">'Wagnerian' and 'Post-Wagnerian' Music</h2>
      <p>British composers’ employment of Wagnerian compositional techniques are discussed at various points throughout this thesis. In summary, such techniques include a sophisticated use of leitmotifs (not only the explicit use of motifs in association with particular characters, objects or ideas, but also a more subtle approach whereby leitmotifs are used to indicate the influence of or relationship between particular persons or events which are not otherwise clear from the dialogue or dramatic action. A Wagnerian approach to leitmotifs also often involves these motifs being thoroughly embedded in the musical texture and developed throughout rather than functioning as simple reminiscence motifs); a through-composed musical structure that avoids or limits the use of set-piece ‘numbers’; a declamatory vocal technique; the frequent avoidance of (conventional) cadences, especially after long periods of dominant tension; an ambiguous or wandering approach to tonality; the frequent exploitation of the enharmonic equivalence of augmented sixth and dominant seventh chords; mediant relationships at various structural levels; an extended use of chromaticism; associative tonality; and tonal pairing. It should be noted that although a number of these musical procedures were not exclusively Wagnerian in nature, they were techniques that became much more commonly used by composers as a result of Wagner’s wide-ranging influence. Moreover, in the works discussed here, their use in combination with each other or in tandem with more specific Wagnerian allusions (musical or otherwise) makes Wagner’s importance evident.</p>
      <p> It is useful to explain the distinction between the terms ‘Wagnerian’ and ‘post-Wagnerian’, both of which will be employed in the chapters that follow. ‘Wagnerian’ is used either as a noun, to refer to a person who is an admirer of Wagner, or as an adjective, to describe characteristics which relate to the work and ideas of Wagner. The term ‘post-Wagnerian’ also relates to characteristics based on or stemming from Wagnerian practices, but refers, too, to things which develop or go beyond Wagner in some way. With regards to music, for example, the works of Holbrooke and Boughton considered in this thesis are more accurately described as post-Wagnerian music because, while fundamentally rooted in Wagnerian compositional techniques and aesthetics, they are also shaped significantly by influences from later composers such as Strauss and Debussy (composers who could also be described as post-Wagnerian).</p>
    </div>
    <p> Part of the reason for British composers’ reluctance to embrace Wagner fully in the 1880s was that to have written an opera that subscribed entirely to Wagner’s theories would have invited accusations of being a mere imitator and epigone in the press. Consequently, a notable trend in British operas of the 1880s and 1890s was the attempt to reconcile the continuous, through-composed music of Wagner’s music dramas with more traditional operatic structures made up of set pieces or ‘numbers’. Steven Huebner suggests that in France, where <em>fin-de-siècle</em> opera composers faced similar challenges in the wake of Wagner, some attempted to achieve this reconciliation by opting for a </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>third way—continuous opera combining well-defined set pieces and leitmotifs—as a viable category of musico-dramatic structure that need not necessarily be measured against Wagner’s achievements.<a id="_ftnref34" href='#_ftn34'>[34]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It was precisely this ‘third way’ or, rather, various third ways that were the chosen solutions for many of the most significant British operas performed during the last two decades of the century. These include operas by Stanford (<em>The Veiled Prophet</em> <em>of Khorassan</em>, 1881; <em>Savonarola</em>, 1884; and <em>The Canterbury Pilgrims</em>, 1884), Mackenzie (<em>Colomba</em>, 1883; and <em>The Troubadour</em>, 1886), and MacCunn (<em>Jeanie Deans</em>, 1894; and <em>Diarmid</em> 1897).<a id="_ftnref35" href='#_ftn35'>[35]</a> None of these operas were entirely unaffected by Wagner’s musical innovations, but equally none of them fully embraced the continuous structure of his music dramas, despite the fact that Mackenzie and MacCunn were both enthusiastic followers of the Meister. In fact, Bantock’s <em>Caedmar</em> (1892) was the only British opera performed before 1900 that was wholeheartedly Wagnerian in this sense.</p>
    <p> In Mackenzie’s case, his desire to find a middle ground is demonstrated by his remarks during an interview with the <em>Musical Times</em> in 1894. Asked ‘Should the music of an opera be continuous (as, for instance, in Wagner) or divided into separate numbers?’, he answered: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Continuous, most decidedly. The division into separate numbers is no longer acceptable to musical thinkers. I do not, of course, wish you to understand by this that an act of an opera should be one long unresolved suspension, or that lyrical moments and soliloquies should not find their full expression in a final cadence; but only that the conventional ‘numbers’—<em>aria</em>, <em>cavatina</em>, &amp;c.—are decidedly of the past.<a id="_ftnref36" href='#_ftn36'>[36]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Although Mackenzie clearly distanced himself from what he regarded as outdated operatic practices in his answer, the reference to ‘one long unresolved suspension’ shows that he also did not wish to be associated too closely with what the critics of the day might have considered the extremes of Wagnerian technique – he chose a third way. However, as Duncan Barker has observed, despite Mackenzie’s dismissal of ‘numbers’, each scene of <em>Colomba</em> and <em>The Troubadour</em> is ‘subtly structured by the use of Italian operatic models such as the aria, the scena, finale ensembles and so on’.<a id="_ftnref37" href='#_ftn37'>[37]</a> Thus, while the music of each act of these operas is mostly continuous, there are a number of distinct set pieces in both <em>Colomba</em> and <em>The Troubadour</em>. </p>
    <p><em>Colomba</em> and <em>The Troubadour</em> might, then, be termed ‘continuous number operas’, a description that it is not unreasonable to apply also to Stanford’s three operas of the 1880s. Jeremy Dibble notes that in the first of these, <em>The Veiled Prophet</em>, ‘Set piece, chorus, and ensemble are clearly delineated’, while <em>Savonarola</em>, though displaying an enhanced ‘sense of continuity’, retains ‘that vital clarity of the “number” opera’.<a id="_ftnref38" href='#_ftn38'>[38]</a> Similarly, <em>The Canterbury Pilgrims</em> retains a sense of continuity within each scene, but ‘its clearly delineated, classical structure of differentiated scenes, in unambiguous closed forms, looks back to the <em>buffa</em> models of <em>Le nozze di Figaro</em> and <em>Così fan tutte</em>’.<a id="_ftnref39" href='#_ftn39'>[39]</a> Rather than Stanford’s operas becoming increasingly Wagnerian, Paul Rodmell observes that <em>The Canterbury Pilgrims</em>, completed after <em>Savonarola</em>, is actually ‘closer to a number opera’ than the earlier work.<a id="_ftnref40" href='#_ftn40'>[40]</a> Even members of the younger generation of British composers maintained crucial aspects of number opera. Hamish MacCunn’s two 1890s operas, <em>Jeanie Deans</em> and <em>Diarmid</em>, while employing a much more adventurous harmonic vocabulary and syntax than the operas of Stanford, Mackenzie and Parry, are equally, if not more conservative in terms of structural continuity.<a id="_ftnref41" href='#_ftn41'>[41]</a></p>
    <p> The fact that these composers retained aspects of number opera in their works does not, however, mean that they eschewed Wagnerian models altogether. Operas such as <em>Der fliegende Holländer</em>, <em>Tannhäuser</em>, <em>Lohengrin</em> and even <em>Die Meistersinger</em> provided more conservative Wagnerians with a group of works which could function as a model for their own operas, acting as an alternative to the <em>Ring</em>, <em>Tristan</em> and <em>Parsifal</em>.<a id="_ftnref42" href='#_ftn42'>[42]</a> Thomas Grey notes, for example, that <em>Der fliegende Holländer</em> was conceived by Wagner ‘largely in terms of the traditional formal types of aria, ensemble, and scene’, but ‘the individual numbers within an act are almost always elided’ – not dissimilar to the ‘third way’ British operas mentioned above.<a id="_ftnref43" href='#_ftn43'>[43]</a> <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, too, is a work whose debt to earlier operatic conventions is evident.<a id="_ftnref44" href='#_ftn44'>[44]</a></p>
    <p> The relative neglect of the issue of British music and Wagnerism in scholarship owes as much, then, to the gradual, and initially conservative, adoption of Wagnerian musical procedures in British music of the late nineteenth century as it does to the lowly historiographical status of some of the British Wagnerian composers from the period. The time lag effect noted above and the limited interaction between Wagnerian composers and some of the more official institutions of British Wagnerism do not, however, preclude the possibility that Large’s three types of Wagnerism could apply to British music, too. The impact on British music of the Shavian strand of Wagnerism identified by Large was limited, but it did at least appear in the form of Rutland Boughton’s music festivals in Glastonbury, considered in Chapter 4.<a id="_ftnref45" href='#_ftn45'>[45]</a> It is Large’s other two types of British Wagnerism, however, that offer more promising templates for British music.</p>

    <h2>Decadence</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">There have already been attempts to frame British music in terms of Large’s first category: decadent Wagnerism. Most notably, Byron Adams has argued that Edward Elgar’s <em>The Dream of Gerontius</em> (1900) and <em>The Apostles</em> (1903) should be seen against a backdrop of <em>fin-de-siècle</em> decadence, highlighting in particular Elgar’s allusions to <em>Parsifal</em>, which act as ‘decadent signifiers’, the importance of Catholicism and Catholic mysticism to decadent aesthetics, and the atmosphere of ‘erotic religiosity’ shared by <em>Parsifal</em> and <em>Gerontius</em>.<a id="_ftnref46" href='#_ftn46'>[46]</a> As Adams’s study demonstrates, decadence certainly played an important role in British musical Wagnerism and its reception around the turn of the century,<a id="_ftnref47" href='#_ftn47'>[47]</a> but I would suggest that the parallels and links between British music and decadent Wagnerism in the other arts can only be taken so far. <em>Gerontius</em>, for instance, was hardly decadent in the way that Aubrey Beardsley’s drawing of Siegfried – as an emaciated, effeminate ‘debilitated decadent’ – was;<a id="_ftnref48" href='#_ftn48'>[48]</a> nor was it decadent in the sense of Richard Strauss’s Wildean opera <em>Salome</em> (1905), with its violent, shocking display of a severed head.</p>
    <p>Far more influential on British composers than the decadence of Beardsley and Wilde was the work of the group of poets and painters known as the Pre-Raphaelites. Founded in 1848, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood’s original members included artists such as Edward Burne-Jones (1833–1898), William Holman Hunt (1827–1910), John Everett Millais (1829–1896) and Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828–1882). Not only were there strong personal connections between the Pre-Raphaelites and prominent figures of nineteenth-century British Wagnerism, but Pre-Raphaelite art also shared a number of common interests with Wagner and Wagnerism, including Arthurianism, Celticism, medievalism, mysticism and the fusion of erotic and religious themes. Moreover, Pre-Raphaelite art acted in certain respects as a precursor to the decadent movement: Dennis Denisoff notes that the Brotherhood anticipated aestheticism and decadence through ‘their attack on the status quo in art, their attention to detail in their work, […] their use of symbols […] [and] the sensuality of their representations of men and women’.<a id="_ftnref49" href='#_ftn49'>[49]</a> A later phase of Pre-Raphaelitism, represented in particular by D. G. Rossetti’s combination of the fleshly and the spiritual, can certainly be seen as a precursor to decadence. It was, then, more often this Pre-Raphaelite form of proto-decadence that intersected with British musical Wagnerism, and as is demonstrated in Chapters 1 and 3, apparently decadent characteristics in British Wagnerian operas and orchestral works from the 1880s and 90s can be best understood through this Pre-Raphaelite lens. </p>
    <p>A greater problem with identifying British musical Wagnerism with decadence lies in the fact that such an approach risks mischaracterising the ends for which British composers called on Wagnerian ideas and techniques. For these composers, more often than not, Wagner offered less a means to indulge in and glorify degeneration than a way of achieving the exact opposite: the re-enchantment or regeneration of the world.<a id="_ftnref50" href='#_ftn50'>[50]</a> As Stephen Downes observes, decadence and regeneration are, of course, two sides of the same coin: renewal must be preceded by decay, and decay implies a fall from a previous higher (perhaps regenerated) state.<a id="_ftnref51" href='#_ftn51'>[51]</a> Consequently, decadence or degeneration is an aspect of most of the works studied in the following chapters, but Wagnerism is construed here (as it was by the composers under study) not just negatively, as a reaction against something, but also positively, as a hope <em>for</em> something.<a id="_ftnref52" href='#_ftn52'>[52]</a></p>
    <p>The themes of regeneration and re-enchantment lead to Large’s third type of British Wagnerism, the kind he suggests was represented by William Ashton Ellis’s belief that Wagner offered an alternative ‘value-system’ to Victorian ‘technological progress’. More to the point, Ellis believed that Wagner provided a path away from what he referred to as ‘the crushing scientific materialism that was gradually tightening its iron grasp’ earlier in the nineteenth century.<a id="_ftnref53" href='#_ftn53'>[53]</a> As Sessa has observed, Ellis was by no means the only English Wagnerian to enlist Wagner in an ‘attack on bourgeois philistinism and in [a] search for new styles of life and art in an age that was to become increasingly uncertain and dissatisfied with itself’.<a id="_ftnref54" href='#_ftn54'>[54]</a> For a large number of English Wagnerites, Sessa concludes, the ‘Bayreuth <em>Festspielhaus</em> was a new church’.<a id="_ftnref55" href='#_ftn55'>[55]</a> As well as ‘scientific materialism’, the kind of values that British Wagnerians, including composers, were reacting against were associated with socio-cultural-political movements such as capitalism, industrialisation, individualism, secularism and the lack of a clear sense of national identity. The worldviews with which they wanted to replace such impulses were related to community, socialism, collectivism, nationalism, mysticism, spirituality, chivalry, heroism and the glorification of nature.</p>

    <h2>Re-enchantment</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">For most British Wagnerian composers, what Wagner ultimately offered was a path towards the ‘re-enchantment’ of the world. In their conclusion to their book <em>Wagnerism in European Culture and Politics</em> David Large and William Weber identify re-enchantment as a key element of Wagner’s allure. They write that Wagner’s <em>Ring</em> cycle, for example</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>offered its largely bourgeois audiences a release or a haven from a world that had become all too ‘demystified’ [disenchanted] (to use Max Weber’s term) through the pressures of industrial modernization. What Wagner achieved, in the end, was a kind of remystification or remythification [re-enchantment] of quite ‘real’ social questions through his compelling use of myth […].<a id="_ftnref56" href='#_ftn56'>[56]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The notion of ‘<em>dis</em>enchantment’ (‘<em>Entzauberung</em>’) is one of the most famous of Max Weber’s ideas, and is explained in the sociologist’s essay ‘Science as a Vocation’, taken from a lecture given in 1917: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The fate of our times is characterized by rationalization and intellectualization and, above all, by the ‘disenchantment of the world.’ Precisely the ultimate and most sublime values have retreated from public life either into the transcendental realm of mystic life or into the brotherliness of direct and personal human relations.<a id="_ftnref57" href='#_ftn57'>[57]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In a disenchanted world there are no longer any ‘mysterious incalculable forces’ at play, but rather ‘one can, in principle, master all things by calculation’.<a id="_ftnref58" href='#_ftn58'>[58]</a> That is, all things, including the natural world,<a id="_ftnref59" href='#_ftn59'>[59]</a> can be subject to the controlling forces of rationalization.<a id="_ftnref60" href='#_ftn60'>[60]</a></p>
    <p>While Weber identified disenchantment and secularization as vital forces of modernity, during the century since he gave his ‘Science as a Vocation’ lecture numerous scholars have recognised that the desire for (re-)enchantment is an equally important facet of modernity (especially so around the <em>fin de siècle</em>).<a id="_ftnref61" href='#_ftn61'>[61]</a> Or, as Christopher Partridge puts it, disenchantment can be seen as ‘the precursor to reenchantment’.<a id="_ftnref62" href='#_ftn62'>[62]</a> The sociologist Richard Jenkins offers the following definition of enchantment:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Enchantment conjures up, and is rooted in, understandings and experiences of the world in which there is more to life than the material, the visible or the explainable; in which the philosophies and principles of Reason or rationality cannot by definition dream of the totality of life; in which the quotidian norms and routines of linear time and space are only part of the story; and in which the collective sum of sociability and belonging is elusively greater than its individual parts.<a id="_ftnref63" href='#_ftn63'>[63]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>For many in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries who could not ‘bear the fate of the times [a disenchanted world] like a man’,<a id="_ftnref64" href='#_ftn64'>[64]</a> the aesthetic sphere served as a rich source of enchantment, offering up experiences that went beyond the ‘material, the visible or the explainable’. As Weber observed, in a climate of increasing intellectualism and rationalization, the aesthetic could become an autonomous value-sphere in which ‘art takes over the function of a this-worldly salvation […]. It provides a <em>salvation</em> from the routines of everyday life, and especially from the increasing pressures of theoretical and practical rationalism’.<a id="_ftnref65" href='#_ftn65'>[65]</a> And of all the arts, Weber wrote, it was music, especially in its ‘purest form’ (absolute instrumental music) that could end up being treated as an ‘<em>Ersatz</em> for primary religious experience’.<a id="_ftnref66" href='#_ftn66'>[66]</a></p>
    <p> The idea that art, and particularly music, could act as an agent of enchantment was not unique to Wagner’s work, but perhaps more than any other artist of the nineteenth century, Wagner provided an especially rich source of inspiration for (re-)enchantment.<a id="_ftnref67" href='#_ftn67'>[67]</a> This was not only because of the intoxicating and spellbinding effects that Wagner’s music had on audiences, but also because the stories of the dramas themselves were full of magical occurrences: magic potions, magic fire, mystical visions, ghost-ships, talking birds, dark magicians, floating spears and so on.<a id="_ftnref68" href='#_ftn68'>[68]</a> Accordingly, many late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century descriptions of Wagner refer to him as a magician, wizard or sorcerer, both in a positive and pejorative sense. Most famously, Nietzsche’s attack on Wagner refers to the composer as an ‘old magician’ (‘<em>Zauberer</em>’), who lured Wagnerites into his den at Bayreuth.<a id="_ftnref69" href='#_ftn69'>[69]</a> Other well-known figures, such as Theodor Adorno, Thomas Mann, Bernard Shaw, and Max Weber discussed Wagner and his music in these terms.<a id="_ftnref70" href='#_ftn70'>[70]</a> The latter wrote in 1912 of the ‘master sorcerer’ (‘<em>Hexenmeister</em>’), Wagner.<a id="_ftnref71" href='#_ftn71'>[71]</a> British Wagnerians, too, used this kind of language when describing Wagner. Frederick Corder, for instance, observed that Wagner’s harmony was inclined to induce ‘a kind of mental intoxication’ in its admirers,<a id="_ftnref72" href='#_ftn72'>[72]</a> and one of the subjects of this thesis, William Wallace, wrote of Wagner ‘the magician who captures and enthrals us by the spell of his music’.<a id="_ftnref73" href='#_ftn73'>[73]</a></p>
    <p> The concept of enchantment, then, may relate to Wagner’s works in a number of ways. Wagner’s music itself has the ability to enchant its listeners, and Wagner also presents the audience in the theatre with an enchanted world on the stage, one in which they can immerse themselves in during the course of the performance. Conversely, one might argue that Wagner’s operas offered no real, lasting re-enchantment at all: the illusion is shattered once the performance is over, and the audience must return to their disenchanted world. The opera provides only a temporary ‘salvation’, and, as Weber observes, the inner-worldly salvation offered by art is only an inferior substitute for otherworldly salvation religion. For some Wagnerites, however, such as Ashton Ellis, the magic of Wagner’s art could genuinely transcend the theatre and guide us towards an ‘invisible world’ that would save mankind from the ‘iron grasp’ of scientific materialism or, in Max Weber’s strikingly similar language, from the ‘iron cage’ of modern capitalist society. While most of the British composers considered here did not take the magic of Wagner’s music dramas as literally as Ellis did, they nonetheless found in his work the themes and means of re-enchantment which they could incorporate into their own music and theories in pursuit of portraying or even creating a re-enchanted world. Re-enchantment provides a useful lens, then, through which to understand the motives and methods of British musical Wagnerism.</p>

    <h2>Regeneration</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">Related to the notion of re-enchantment, and equally important to the understanding of British music and Wagnerism, is the concept of regeneration. As Aidan Thomson has pointed out, this impulse is often associated with the conservative values and anti-Semitic Wagnerism of the <em>Bayreuther Blätter</em>, Houston Stewart Chamberlain and a series of Wagner’s essays dating from the late 1870s and early 1880s (his so-called ‘Regeneration’ writings).<a id="_ftnref74" href='#_ftn74'>[74]</a> Thomson also identifies a regeneration narrative in <em>Parsifal</em>, ‘whereby an ideal realm is first corrupted and then “redeemed”’, suggesting that in this reading the drama is ‘not goal-directed but rather cyclical, ahistorical, and thus also antimodernist and antiprogress’.<a id="_ftnref75" href='#_ftn75'>[75]</a> Thomson’s article explores how this narrative of regeneration was used by Elgar as a model for his own works, in combination with the Wagnerian ‘metaphor of chivalry’ that ‘represented the means to a regeneration of art and society’.<a id="_ftnref76" href='#_ftn76'>[76]</a></p>
    <p> While this conservative strand of Wagnerian regeneration was certainly influential on composers across Europe, themes of regeneration in Wagnerian musical works took on many diverse forms. Nonetheless, such works often shared the cyclical aspect outlined by Thomson, and were almost always tied to the renewal of a particular nation and its people. While for some artists Wagnerism offered a retreat into the erotic or aesthetic spheres, others used the Wagnerian framework of collapse and renewal (corruption and regeneration) to express more explicitly political or nationalistic ideas in order to encourage audiences to imagine a better world and perhaps, as Warren Darcy suggests is the case with Wagner’s <em>Ring</em>, even suggest to them ‘the <em>means</em> of transforming society’.<a id="_ftnref77" href='#_ftn77'>[77]</a></p>
    <p>Part of the appeal of plots involving the collapse or corruption of a society, ideal or entire world, and the subsequent promise or attainment of regeneration was that composers and librettists could fill this framework with practically any nation, community, political ideology, religious ideal or anything else they liked. Works which form part of this collapse and (promise of) renewal category usually display a number of common themes. First, they are characterised by liminality. These works are liminal in a temporal sense because they often portray a society or age that is about to come to an end and be replaced with a new one. They are liminal in a spatial sense because the setting for such works is often on or near a border between two countries, between land and sea, land and sky, or in a place where two peoples, races or cultures meet and clash. Liminality may also present itself in the form of characters who are depicted as beings that are somewhere between man and god and who thus exist at the border between this and some other world.</p>
    <p>A second common characteristic of these works is their preoccupation with Nordic and Celtic themes and settings, often chosen, in part, because of Wagner’s influence. Celtic worlds were particularly prominent in the works of British and French composers, a fact that goes hand in hand with the liminality of these works. The Celtic nations – Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Cornwall and the Isle of Man in the British Isles, and Brittany in France – are all located at geographical peripheries, not only in relation to Britain and France but in relation to the continent of Europe as a whole. Third, these works frequently include a battle between some native people and invading outsiders, or a conflict between two warring factions within the same society (as in Arthurian legend). Fourth, there is usually a pair of lovers who are in some way caught up in, or a cause of, the conflict. More often than not, one or both of them die before the work’s conclusion. Finally, the collapse of the world, society, order or ideal comes with an implicit or explicit promise of regeneration which is implicitly or explicitly linked to the contemporary world or nation of the composer.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the chief example of a work by a British composer that falls into this category is not an opera but Edward Elgar’s 1898 cantata <em>Caractacus</em>. In <em>Caractacus</em>, the eponymous Celtic chieftain is defeated by the Romans in the area around the River Severn and the Malvern Hills – that is, near the (modern) border between England and Wales – and this signals the end of a particular, Celtic version of Britain. The work’s epilogue, however, is written for its nineteenth-century audience and lauds the far-reaching British Empire, viewed as a British-Roman synthesis that has emerged (been regenerated) from the ashes of both Celtic Britain and the Roman Empire (<em>Caractacus</em> and its epilogue in particular is discussed in greater detail, and in relation to Wagner, in Chapter 2).</p>
    <p>It is instructive to compare Elgar’s cantata with Hamish MacCunn’s 1897 opera <em>Diarmid</em>, set in second-century ‘Erin or Scotia’ (Ireland or Scotland). The opera displays many of the characteristics outlined above, yet does not quite fit into the collapse and (promise of) renewal category. This is because the end of the drama provides no clear indication of future regeneration or any hint that this might be linked to the present world. The fact that the Celtic ‘Immortal Heroes’ (gods) offer Diarmid redemption at the end of the opera, however, shows that <em>Diarmid</em> is a redemption opera, another common (post-)Wagnerian operatic type identified by Barbara Eichner. One of Eichner’s examples of such an opera is Karl Grammann’s <em>Thusnelda</em> (1881), the conclusion of which, Eichner argues, ‘is a case in point’: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>As Thusnelda dies, an electric ray of light falls on her head, surrounding it like a halo. She envisages the hall of the gods and Hermann welcoming her, and prophesises that German warriors will invade Rome victoriously. Her dying scene, therefore, points beyond the actual plot towards a brighter future and a higher purpose, which ennobles her suicide into a sacrifice for the (future) German nation.<a id="_ftnref78" href='#_ftn78'>[78]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>There is some overlap here with the collapse and (promise of) renewal opera type described above. This is further demonstrated by the fact that Ernest Chausson’s <em>Le roi Arthus</em>, considered below as a collapse and renewal (regeneration) opera, is also listed by Eichner as a redemption opera. Nonetheless, while redemption operas are often also collapse and renewal operas, the two categories are not always one and the same. <em>Diarmid</em>, for instance, is a redemption opera but not a collapse and renewal opera, and the same is true of Bantock’s opera <em>Caedmar</em>, discussed in Chapter 3; <em>Caractacus</em>, on the other hand, is a collapse and renewal work but lacks a transcendental, redemptive death at its conclusion. Parry’s opera <em>Guenever</em> (1884–6; see Chapter 1) is a redemption opera <em>and</em> a collapse and renewal work.</p>
    <p> In <em>fin-de-siècle</em> France numerous Wagnerian composers produced operas which exhibited themes of destruction and renewal. These include Vincent d’Indy’s Celtic-themed opera <em>Fervaal</em> (premiered in 1897 but conceived as early as 1886),<a id="_ftnref79" href='#_ftn79'>[79]</a> as well as Ernest Chausson’s <em>Le roi Arthus</em> (‘King Arthur’) (1886–95; prem. 1903). In Act II of Chausson’s opera the character of Merlin predicts the imminent destruction of the fellowship of the Round table: ‘What we once achieved is now destroyed! / The Round Table is doomed to extinction’. However, at the end of the opera, following Arthus’s final farewell to his ‘beloved Brittany’ and his departure on the barge, an invisible chorus offers hope of rebirth and renewal:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>You shall come back again in a blaze of glory
        To the land that you left in such utter despair!
        You shall continue the great work you began,
        And take up your mighty weapons once more!<a id="_ftnref80" href='#_ftn80'>[80]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Steven Huebner observes that the ending of the opera ‘encloses a strong sense of Arthus as pure idea’. Indeed, it is the ideals that Arthus represents, more than the man himself, that the final chorus celebrates and of which it prophesises the return: ‘the Round Table will collapse, but its ideals will survive’.<a id="_ftnref81" href='#_ftn81'>[81]</a> Given the opera’s setting in Brittany, the rebirth of the ‘Ideal World’ at some point in the future is presumably supposed to be projected onto contemporary France, making Chausson’s opera, like most collapse and (promise of) renewal operas, also a nationalistic one.</p>
    <p> As these French examples illustrate, themes of regeneration and redemption were not unique to British music’s particular take on Wagnerism but rather themes that were found in musical manifestations of the phenomenon across Europe during the decades straddling the turn of the century. Nonetheless, nationalism is an important element of practically every chapter following this Introduction, and in most cases this is related to the Arthurian or Celtic dimension of the works considered. </p>
    <p>In addition to Arthurianism, Celticism, nationalism and the overarching themes of re-enchantment and regeneration, there are a number of other recurring topics that unite the chapters of this thesis, including Pre-Raphaelitism, attempts to portray or create cohesive communities, ideas about the fusion or translatability of the arts, and themes of redemption, illicit love and (largely subdued) eroticism. Given the wide range of subject matter considered by this thesis, then, it is important to note that the choice of the title ‘British Music <em>and</em> Wagnerism’ rather than ‘British <em>Musical</em> Wagnerism’ is deliberate, emphasising the fact that this study is concerned not only with Wagner’s influence on the compositional technique of British composers, though that is one aspect of the following chapters.<a id="_ftnref82" href='#_ftn82'>[82]</a> In addition, this thesis considers the myriad other ways in which Wagner’s music dramas and ideas had an impact on composers’ works (including choice of themes, the poetic technique and content of librettos, and the staging of music dramas), as well as the Wagnerian dimensions of these composers’ and their collaborators’ writings, politics and aesthetics more generally. In the case of all the individuals and works studied here, there are, of course, many influences at play beyond Wagnerian ones, and in some cases these other forces at work are no less important. But viewing all these things through the lens of Wagnerism reveals aspects of these people’s ideas and projects that would not be so clear if viewed from any other perspective.</p>
    
    <h2>Scope and Content</h2>
    <p class="first-para-section">Each of the following chapters is centred around the work(s) of a particular composer or pair of composers who have been chosen in part because their work illustrates the themes outlined above, but also for a number of other reasons. The subjects of Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6 were all members of the RAM-Midlands group of composers referred to above. All of them, with the exception of Rutland Boughton, studied composition under Corder at the RAM, while Boughton became associated with the group through his connections with Bantock and the Midlands Institute. Bantock was in certain respects the leader of this group, while Elgar, the focus of Chapter 2, acted as a kind of honorary president: Elgar stood apart from this group but at the same time acted as a role model for its members, all of whom greatly admired his music.<a id="_ftnref83" href='#_ftn83'>[83]</a></p>
    <p>I have identified 1880 as the beginning of British musical Wagnerism because that year saw the premiere of Hubert Parry’s <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>. That this work was later identified as ushering in the English Musical Renaissance was surely in part due to the fact that contemporary critics aligned the work with Wagner.<a id="_ftnref84" href='#_ftn84'>[84]</a> Even if the comparisons with Wagner were exaggerated, <em>Prometheus</em> was the earliest English work to adopt Wagnerian compositional procedures and to combine these with a Wagnerian scenario.<a id="_ftnref85" href='#_ftn85'>[85]</a> The end date of 1920 has been chosen in part because it broadly corresponds with the end of the Wagnerian era identified by Koppen, and other musicologists, such as Carl Dahlhaus, have argued that by ‘the early 1920s […] Wagner’s influence as part of an “authentic” way of composing that was adequate to the historical situation had come to an end’.<a id="_ftnref86" href='#_ftn86'>[86]</a> Events more specifically related to British music and Wagnerism further illustrate the significance of 1920: it was the year in which Joseph Holbrooke completed the composition of his operatic trilogy and which saw the first complete performance of the first drama of Rutland Boughton’s Arthurian pentalogy (see Chapters 4 and 5); and Bax’s tone poem <em>Tintagel</em> (1917–19), the subject of the final chapter, was completed just a year earlier in 1919, and premiered in 1921. </p>
    <p> Chapter 1’s focus on Hubert Parry might initially seem like an unusual choice for the beginning of a study of British music and Wagnerism. Parry’s association with the RCM, his reputation as a Brahmsian composer and the various disparaging remarks he made about opera all suggest that he would have been an unlikely candidate to compose one of the first British Wagnerian operas. But Parry’s close friendship with and mentorship from one of the movers and shakers of early British Wagnerism, the German-born Edward Dannreuther, meant that he was closely involved with the activities of the London Wagner Society and one of the few British composers to meet Wagner himself in 1877. Although Parry eventually turned his back on the idea that the future of British music might lie in a Wagnerian direction, he seems to have entertained such a possibility in the 1880s. While <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> (1880) was perhaps the first landmark in British musical Wagnerism, the impact of Wagner on Parry is clearest in his abandoned attempt at opera, <em>Guenever</em> (1884–6), and consequently it is that work which acts as the case study for Chapter 1.</p>
    <p><em>Guenever</em>, an opera which was unfinished (Parry never orchestrated it) and never performed, might also seem like an odd choice, particularly as there were a number of other British operas displaying Wagnerian characteristics that were completed and performed in the 1880s – most notably, those by Stanford and Mackenzie mentioned above. However, none of these other works anticipated, to the same extent that Parry’s aborted opera did, the themes found in the later manifestations of British musical Wagnerism considered here. Moreover, the 1880s operas of Stanford and Mackenzie do not occupy the same timeless, mythical universe shared by Parry’s <em>Guenever</em> (based on Arthurian legends), all of the other operas considered in this thesis, and Wagner’s <em>Ring</em>, <em>Tristan</em> and <em>Parsifal</em>. Instead, most of Stanford’s and Mackenzie’s 1880s operas were based on historical figures and were set in the Middle Ages (<em>Savonarola</em>, <em>The Canterbury Pilgrims</em> and <em>The Troubadour</em>), nineteenth-century Corsica (<em>Colomba</em>) and the Orient (<em>The Veiled Prophet</em> <em>of Khorassan</em>).</p>
    <p>Although Parry was not closely associated with some of the other composers considered in this thesis, and despite the fact that some of those composers held less than complimentary opinions of Parry’s music, <em>Guenever</em> nonetheless displays many of the characteristics and themes that came to define British music’s relationship with Wagnerism in the three decades following its composition: the intersection of Wagnerism with Pre-Raphaelitism, for instance, is considered both in relation to Parry and again in Chapter 3 in relation to William Wallace; the related but broader issue of interart relations in British Wagnerism returns in a number of chapters; the relationship between Arthurian legends, with their inherently cyclical and regenerative potential, and Wagnerism is explored also in relation to Rutland Boughton in Chapter 4; and, finally, regeneration generally is a topic that runs throughout this thesis.</p>
    <p>While the Wagnerism of Parry’s <em>Guenever</em> is, on the whole, much more in keeping with that found in the works of the other composers who form the focus of the following chapters, there are some aspects of the operas of Stanford and Mackenzie that foreshadow the kind of Wagnerism considered in the second chapter of this thesis. In particular, Stanford’s <em>The Canterbury Pilgrims</em> is representative of a conservative strand of British musical Wagnerism that drew its inspiration primarily from <em>Die Meistersinger</em>.<a id="_ftnref87" href='#_ftn87'>[87]</a> Stanford had many reservations about Wagner’s music dramas but he praised the ‘greatness and nobility’ of the German composer’s ‘broad diatonics’, and was keen to distinguish the ‘Wagner of unbridled excitement and sensuality’ from the ‘other side’ of Wagner, which was ‘clean’ and represented above all by <em>Die Meistersinger</em>.<a id="_ftnref88" href='#_ftn88'>[88]</a></p>
    <p> In Chapter 2, then, I propose that a version of this strand of Wagnerism (without the comedic dimension) can be identified in certain orchestral and choral works by Edward Elgar, especially in <em>Caractacus</em> (1898), <em>Cockaigne</em> (1901) and <em>The Kingdom</em> (1906). In contrast to previous examinations of Elgar’s Wagnerism which have focussed on decadence, chromaticism and the influence of <em>Parsifal</em>, this study instead reveals a kind of Elgarian Wagnerism connected to ideas of community and fellowship, diatonicism and the influence of <em>Die Meistersinger</em>. The aspects of Elgar’s Wagnerism that are explored in Chapter 2 are linked to the other manifestations of Wagnerism considered in later chapters through the fact that Elgar, too, enlisted Wagner as part of a reaction against a disenchanted world and a fractured, individualistic society. For Elgar, Wagner’s late works, especially <em>Die Meistersinger</em> and <em>Parsifal</em>, offered models of conservative communities united by art, religion or nation that Elgar wished to emulate in his own works and project onto contemporary English society. </p>
    <p>Chapter 3 explores the ways in which William Wallace and Granville Bantock spearheaded a progressive movement in British music in the 1890s that was inspired by the musical works and ideas of Wagner, as well as those of Franz Liszt. I show how this pair of composers promoted their progressive and (post-)Wagnerian agenda not only through their music, but also through their journal the <em>New Quarterly Musical Review</em> (1893–6), through a concert they organised at the Queen’s Hall in 1896 and through the aesthetic ideas articulated in their published writings. The latter part of Chapter 3 examines two case studies of British musical Wagnerism: Wallace’s symphonic poem, <em>The Passing of Beatrice</em>, and Bantock’s one-act opera <em>Caedmar</em> – works which were premiered just a month apart from each other in 1892. Each work illustrates, in a different way, British musical Wagnerism’s tendency towards re-enchantment. While Wallace’s <em>Beatrice</em> draws on a Wagnerian musical language associated with both the mystical and erotic, anticipating the kind of Wagnerism found later in Elgar’s <em>The Dream of Gerontius</em>, Bantock’s opera is the first of many British Wagnerian works which depicts a re-enchanted, pantheistic Celtic world.</p>
    <p>Chapters 4 and 5 examine three operas which formed part of two of the most ambitious British Wagnerian projects: <em>The Birth of Arthur</em> (1908–9), the first drama of Rutland Boughton’s Arthurian operatic pentalogy, <em>Arthur of Britain</em>; and <em>The Children of Don</em> (1909–12) and <em>Dylan: Son of the Wave</em> (1908–10), the first two parts of Joseph Holbrooke’s trilogy, <em>The Cauldron of Annwn</em> (1908–20). The first of these chapters, on Boughton, considers how the composer and his librettist, Reginald R. Buckley (1882–1919), attempted to reinvent the Wagnerian <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em> through their ‘choral dramas’ performed at Boughton’s Glastonbury festivals. It was Glastonbury that G. B. Shaw identified as the place where ‘the Wagnerist dream has been best realized in England’, and which consequently allowed Boughton to ‘claim to be a Perfect Wagnerite’.<a id="_ftnref89" href='#_ftn89'>[89]</a></p>
    <p>While Boughton was happy to position himself as an heir to Wagner, Holbrooke resented and frequently complained about the Wagnerian reputation that his trilogy of music dramas had earned him. Nonetheless, the <em>Cauldron of Annwn</em> dramas, based on a libretto created out of Welsh legends by Holbrooke’s wealthy patron Lord Howard de Walden (otherwise known as Thomas Evelyn Scott-Ellis; 1880–1946), are saturated with Wagnerism. In addition to considering some of the multitude of Wagnerian allusions in the libretto and score, I demonstrate the importance of nationalism in Holbrooke’s writings and musical works. Unlike the nationalism of the other composers considered here, Holbrooke’s nationalism was explicitly and consistently xenophobic and – rare among British followers of Wagner – virulently anti-Semitic. Holbrooke’s interest in Celticism, expressed in his works and writings, is also explored, and I show that the Celtic pantheistic strand of Wagnerism that first appeared in Bantock’s <em>Caedmar</em> re-emerges in Holbrooke’s operas.</p>
    <p>Celticism and Wagnerism intersect once more in the work that acts as the case study for the final chapter of this thesis: Arnold Bax’s tone poem <em>Tintagel</em> (1917–19).<a id="_ftnref90" href='#_ftn90'>[90]</a> The analysis and hermeneutic reading of Bax’s <em>Tintagel</em> offered in Chapter 6 brings together a number of the Wagnerian threads considered in previous chapters: the Celtic Cornish landmark of Tintagel Castle calls up both Arthurian legends and the influence of Wagner’s <em>Tristan</em>; the <em>Tristan</em> connection, solidified by Bax’s allusion to a motif from Wagner’s drama, is entwined with themes of illicit erotic love; an enchanted Celtic sea is prominent throughout; and, most importantly, there is a regeneration narrative embedded in the work’s structure that is, in my reading at least, tied up with death, redemption and nationalism. Bax’s Celtic Wagnerism differed fundamentally from that of the composers studied in previous chapters, however, because it attached itself not to a form of British nationalism but to Irish republican nationalism. Bax’s Wagnerism, then, is considered in an Irish as well as a British context (Ireland, of course, was still part of the union of the United Kingdom at the time Bax composed <em>Tintagel</em>).</p>
    <p>The study of Bax’s tone poem acts as an effective conclusion to this thesis because it illustrates not only many of the common themes of British musical Wagnerism during the period, but also the moment at which Wagnerism ceased to be a significant force in British music. As Aidan Thomson has observed, Bax turned away from mythological themes after the First World War and his music began to focus instead on Celtic landscapes and seascapes stripped of their links to the ‘feminine’, sentimental and, I argue, Wagnerian elements associated with the Celtic Twilight movement.<a id="_ftnref91" href='#_ftn91'>[91]</a> In comparison with many of Bax’s tone poems composed before it, such as <em>The Garden of Fand</em> (1914–16), <em>Tintagel</em> focusses more on nature than mythology and thus represents this aesthetic shift that took place in his musical work. I suggest that this shift might also be seen as indicative of a broader rejection of the themes and methods associated with Wagnerism around this time. </p>
    <p>Inevitably, there are other composers who could feature in a study of British music and Wagnerism such as this, and given the extraordinary reach of Wagner’s music and ideas there were few British composers active between 1880 and 1920 who were not influenced by him. In any case, it is worth justifying three of the most notable absences: those of Ethel Smyth (1858–1944), Frederick Delius (1862–1934) and Gustav Holst (1874–1934). Smyth’s first three operas were Wagnerian in various ways, but their eligibility to be considered in relation to <em>British</em> Wagnerism is less certain due to the fact that all three were premiered in Germany and sung in German: <em>Fantasio</em> (1892–4; prem. Weimar 1898), <em>Der Wald</em> (1899–1901; prem. Berlin 1902), and <em>Strandrecht</em> (1902–4; prem. Leipzig 1906).<a id="_ftnref92" href='#_ftn92'>[92]</a> <em>Der Wald</em> and <em>Strandrecht</em> were both performed in England after their German premieres and given English titles but Aidan Thomson notes that the scenario of the first of these ‘owed little, if anything to British culture’, and Elizabeth Kertesz has emphasised <em>Der Wald</em>’s relation to the Weberian tradition of German Romantic opera.<a id="_ftnref93" href='#_ftn93'>[93]</a> The Britishness of <em>The Wreckers</em>, however, is less easily dismissed. Its Cornish setting and tale of illicit love between its protagonists, Mark and Thirza, who are drowned together at the end of the opera not only alludes to Wagner’s <em>Tristan</em>, but also to themes that are shared with a number of the Wagnerian works considered in this thesis: namely, Celticism and a related, pantheistic and enchanted notion of nature (and especially of the sea).<a id="_ftnref94" href='#_ftn94'>[94]</a> In one crucial respect, though, <em>The Wreckers</em> differs from the other British Wagnerian operas considered in this thesis: its scenario is not based on mythology or set in some mythical Britain of the past, and its cast is not populated by gods, wizards or elves. Instead, the events of the opera take place in the eighteenth century and are inspired by the real-world practice of wrecking. </p>
    <p> Delius presents similar problems to Smyth, in that while there is no doubt of Wagner’s impact on his music, it can be difficult to situate him and his works in a British context. Like Smyth, Delius studied for a time at the Leipzig Conservatory (in the 1880s), and he spent much of his life on the Continent rather than in Britain. One of Delius’s more obviously Wagnerian works, his opera <em>A Village Romeo and Juliet</em> (1899–1901), was, like Smyth’s operas, premiered in Germany (Berlin, 1907) and produced for the first time in England in February 1910. Wilfrid Mellers has observed that Delius’s opera shares with Wagner’s <em>Tristan</em> the theme of ‘the impossibility of achieving identity between flesh and spirit in the temporal world’, and he writes that ‘Delius’s lovers […] are destroyed, like Wagner’s more mature lovers, by the world of material possessions and social obligations’.<a id="_ftnref95" href='#_ftn95'>[95]</a> In addition, Barbara Eichner has highlighted various musical allusions to <em>Tristan</em> and <em>Götterdämmerung</em> in <em>A Village Romeo and Juliet</em>.<a id="_ftnref96" href='#_ftn96'>[96]</a> Ultimately, Eichner argues, <em>A Village</em> <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> should be seen in the context of a wider group of late-Romantic operas and tone poems, including <em>The Wreckers</em>, which involve some kind of ‘Liebestod’, favour inner drama over outer action, and often culminate with (or portray) death, dissolution or redemption by means of water.<a id="_ftnref97" href='#_ftn97'>[97]</a> The ‘Liebestod’ theme and the death-by-water climax align <em>A Village Romeo and Juliet</em> with some of the British Wagnerian works considered in this thesis, but, crucially, Delius’s opera lacks the British national-mythical dimension found in most of these other works.<a id="_ftnref98" href='#_ftn98'>[98]</a></p>
    <p>In the case of Holst, Christopher Scheer has already provided an interesting examination of the composer’s relationship with Wagnerism during early twentieth-century. In particular, Scheer considers the ways in which three of Holst’s operas – <em>Sita</em> (1899–1906), <em>Sāvitri</em> (1908) and <em>The Perfect Fool</em> (1918–1922) – display the influence of Wagner, whether through musical techniques and allusion, Wagnerian themes in the libretto (such as love and redemption), shared or similar political ideas and philosophies, or, in the case of <em>The Perfect Fool</em>, through parody.<a id="_ftnref99" href='#_ftn99'>[99]</a> While <em>Sita</em> and <em>Sāvitri</em> come closer to the mythical universe of Wagner than Smyth’s <em>The Wreckers</em> or Delius’s <em>A Village Romeo and Juliet</em>, they are both based on ancient Indian Sanskrit texts rather than British themes or settings, and, consequently, these dramas would not fit so well with the group of works considered here. Moreover, Holst, like Smyth and Delius, was not part of the RAM-Midlands circle of composers represented by most of the other composers who form the focus of this thesis. Holbrooke’s derisive remarks about Holst and Vaughan Williams, quoted in Chapter 5, are indicative of the division that existed among British composers in the early twentieth century, a split that Edmund Rubbra later referred to as an ‘opposition’ between ‘the Holst-Vaughan Williams ethos and that summarised by the music of such composers as Scott, Delius, Ireland and Bax’ (I would suggest that the likes of Bantock, Wallace and Holbrooke could be included in this second group, too).<a id="_ftnref100" href='#_ftn100'>[100]</a></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>In the latter half of the twentieth century, commentators often made pejorative remarks about the quality, technical ability or lasting significance of the music of this group of composers,<a id="_ftnref101" href='#_ftn101'>[101]</a> but this does not justify the scholarly neglect of their contribution to British musical culture at the <em>fin de siècle</em> and in the early twentieth century. I hope, then, that what follows will provide not only an interesting addition to the literature on Wagnerism and stimulating readings of particular works, but also a fresh perspective on the history of British music in general that might contribute to shifting composers, and issues relating to their music – Celticism and related pantheistic representations of nature, British over English nationalism, ideas about race, and Pre-Rapahaelite and Arthurian influences – that have hitherto been largely neglected by, or have languished on the periphery of British music studies to the centre of its concerns.</p>

      <p><a id="_ftn32" href='#_ftnref32'>[32]</a> British composers’ employment of Wagnerian compositional techniques are discussed at various points throughout this thesis. In summary, such techniques include a sophisticated use of leitmotifs (not only the explicit use of motifs in association with particular characters, objects or ideas, but also a more subtle approach whereby leitmotifs are used to indicate the influence of or relationship between particular persons or events which are not otherwise clear from the dialogue or dramatic action. A Wagnerian approach to leitmotifs also often involves these motifs being thoroughly embedded in the musical texture and developed throughout rather than functioning as simple reminiscence motifs); a through-composed musical structure that avoids or limits the use of set-piece ‘numbers’; a declamatory vocal technique; the frequent avoidance of (conventional) cadences, especially after long periods of dominant tension; an ambiguous or wandering approach to tonality; the frequent exploitation of the enharmonic equivalence of augmented sixth and dominant seventh chords; mediant relationships at various structural levels; an extended use of chromaticism; associative tonality; and tonal pairing. It should be noted that although a number of these musical procedures were not exclusively Wagnerian in nature, they were techniques that became much more commonly used by composers as a result of Wagner’s wide-ranging influence. Moreover, in the works discussed here, their use in combination with each other or in tandem with more specific Wagnerian allusions (musical or otherwise) makes Wagner’s importance evident.</p>
      <p><a id="_ftn33" href='#_ftnref33'>[33]</a> It is useful to explain the distinction between the terms ‘Wagnerian’ and ‘post-Wagnerian’, both of which will be employed in the chapters that follow. ‘Wagnerian’ is used either as a noun, to refer to a person who is an admirer of Wagner, or as an adjective, to describe characteristics which relate to the work and ideas of Wagner. The term ‘post-Wagnerian’ also relates to characteristics based on or stemming from Wagnerian practices, but refers, too, to things which develop or go beyond Wagner in some way. With regards to music, for example, the works of Holbrooke and Boughton considered in this thesis are more accurately described as post-Wagnerian music because, while fundamentally rooted in Wagnerian compositional techniques and aesthetics, they are also shaped significantly by influences from later composers such as Strauss and Debussy (composers who could also be described as post-Wagnerian).</p>

Interestingly, Weber himself thought the idea that <em>Parsifal</em> could be regarded as a ‘religious experience’ was ‘simply ridiculous’, although he greatly admired <em>Tristan</em>: he and his wife were ‘completely carried away by its ecstasy and experienced this work of art as the highest transfiguration of the earthly’.

      <p><a id="_ftn67" href='#_ftnref67'>[67]</a> Julian Johnson points out that while music may be understood, in part, as a form of enchantment, it is in fact ‘less one-dimensional’ than this ‘because it too is marked by the same processes of rationality that lead to the disenchantment of modernity’. Nonetheless, for most of the composers studied here, what they regarded as an overly ‘rational’, academic understanding of and approach to composing music was exactly what that they wished to distance themselves from (see Chapter 3 in particular).
