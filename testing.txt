<h1>CHAPTER 4</h1>
<h1>Boughton, The Perfect Wagnerite</h1>
<p>I have set myself to teach the British public about Wagner—for the simple reason that if they do not understand Wagner they will not understand me. And that would be a pity!<a id="_ftnref1" href='#_ftn1'>[1]</a></p>
<p>-     Rutland Boughton</p>
<p>In 1911 Rutland Boughton and Reginald R. Buckley published a short book outlining their vision for a new kind of music drama. They called it ‘choral drama’ and at the back of their manifesto was the libretto for the first of these dramas, entitled <em>Uther and Igraine</em> (later renamed <em>The Birth of Arthur</em>). The publication’s self-consciously Wagnerian title, <em>Music-Drama of the Future</em>, reflected its authors’ equally intentional ‘continuation of the German master’s drama’, to which they were ‘greatly indebted’ but which in their view had also ‘failed thoroughly to achieve’ what their planned cycle of Arthurian choral dramas would.<a id="_ftnref2" href='#_ftn2'>[2]</a> While the pair’s ambitious plans to build a theatre in which to perform their dramas, and to construct an agricultural commune around it,<a id="_ftnref3" href='#_ftn3'>[3]</a> never fully materialised, they did lead to a series of festivals held in Glastonbury between 1914 and 1927.<a id="_ftnref4" href='#_ftn4'>[4]</a> In the fourth edition of <em>The Perfect Wagnerite</em> George Bernard Shaw described these festivals as ‘Little Bayreuth’, and their organiser, Boughton, as a ‘Perfect Wagnerite’.<a id="_ftnref5" href='#_ftn5'>[5]</a>
